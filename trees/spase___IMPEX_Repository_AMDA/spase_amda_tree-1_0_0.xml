            <Description>The objective of the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is to collect observations of particles of solar, interplanetary, interstellar, and galactic origins, spanning the energy range from that of KeV solar wind ions to galactic cosmic ray nuclei up to 600 MeV/nucleon. Definitive studies will be made of the abundances of essentially all isotopes from H to Zn (Z = 1-30), with exploratory isotope studies extending to Zr (Z = 40). The ACE payload includes six high resolution spectrometers, each designed to provide the optimum charge, mass, or charge-state resolution in its particular energy range. Each spectrometer has a geometry factor optimized for the expected flux levels, so as to provide a collecting power greater by a factor of 10-1000 times that of previous or planned experiments. The payload also includes three additional instruments of standard design to monitor energetic electrons, H and He ions, and a magnetometer. The ACE spacecraft is based on the design of the Charge Composition Explorer, built at JHU/APL for the Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer (AMPTE) program. The spacecraft spin axis is pointed towards the Sun to within +/- 20 degrees, and it occupies a halo orbit about the L1 Earth-Sun libration point. Powered by solar cells, the spacecraft has a design life of at least five years, and it returns data in daily tape recorder dumps, received through NASA JPL's Deep Space Network and initially processed at NASA-GSFC. The average data telemetry rate is 6.7 Kbs.</Description>

            <Description>This Cluster II spacecraft, FM5 (Rumba), is also known as Phoenix, after a mythical Arabian bird which was burnt on a funeral pile and then rose from the ashes to live again. The original Cluster of four spacecraft experienced a launch failure in 1996. (NSSDC will carry the name &quot;Cluster96&quot; in its information files to designate the unsuccessful 1996 four-spacecraft Ariane 5 launch.)
                
                Phoenix was approved in July 1996 as a replacement for the lost four-spacecraft group. It was later (April 1997) agreed that the potential science return from a full Cluster reflight was so important that a further three near-replicas of the original spacecraft would also be built.
                
                This Cluster II spacecraft, FM5 (Rumba), was launched together with FM8 (Tango) by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur. The four similar spacecraft of the Cluster II mission are part of ESA's and NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Science Program (STSP). The purpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in three dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment, such as those involved in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics, in cross-tail currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.
                
                The four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally 4 x 19.6 Earth radii, with period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances between the spacecraft will be adjusted in the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of the structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred km to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral formation is essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining the curl of vectorial quantities such as the magnetic field.
                
                The orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations. See http://jsoc1.bnsc.rl.ac.uk/pub/PlanningData.html for ongoing updates of orbital information and other status.
                
                Each spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape, with a 2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m experiment wire booms, and two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will be 2 to 262 kbit/s.
                
                Each spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron emitter/detector, an electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle detector, an ion emitter, and a data processing unit.
                
                Cluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space Network. Cluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a medium to the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres (6 in Europe, 1 in USA and 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS). There are approximately 80 recipients world-wide. Science operations are carried out by the Joint Science Operations Centre, co-located with the UK data centre at RAL, Didcot. A wide scientific community will have differing rights of access to the Cluster data. Scientists wishing to access Cluster data should contact their national Data Centres.
                
                The Cluster Summary Parameters are publicly available on CDAWeb at http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdaweb/istp_public and the Prime Parameters are available on CDAWeb at http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdaweb/ to project personnel (password-protected).

                An article on 'The Resurrection of the Cluster Scientific Mission' was published in ESA Bulletin no. 91 (August 1997).
                
                A complete overview of the original mission, written before the loss with Ariane-5, was given in a series of articles in ESA Bulletin no. 84 (November 1995).

            <Description>This Cluster II spacecraft, FM8 (Tango), was launched together with FM5 (Rumba) by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur. The four similar spacecraft of the Cluster II mission are part of ESA's and NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Science Program (STSP). The current Cluster II mission is a near-replica of the original four-spacecraft mission lost at launch in 1996. (NSSDC will carry the name &quot;Cluster96&quot; in its information files to designate the unsuccessful 1996 four-spacecraft Ariane 5 launch.) The purpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in three dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment, such as those involved in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics, in cross-tail currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.
                
                The four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally 4 x 19.6 Earth radii, with period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances between the spacecraft will be adjusted in the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of the structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred km to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral formation is essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining the curl of vectorial quantities such as the magnetic field.
                
                The orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations. See http://jsoc1.bnsc.rl.ac.uk/pub/PlanningData.html for ongoing updates of orbital information and other status.
                
                Each spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape, with a 2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m experiment wire booms, and two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will be 2 to 262 kbit/s.
                
                Each spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron emitter/detector, an electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle detector, an ion emitter, and a data processing unit.
                
                Cluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space Network. Cluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a medium to the Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres (6 in Europe, 1 in USA and 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS). There are approximately 80 recipients world-wide. Science operations are carried out by the Joint Science Operations Centre, co-located with the UK data centre at RAL, Didcot. A wide scientific community will have differing rights of access to the Cluster data. Scientists wishing to access Cluster data should contact their national Data Centres.

            <Description>Double Star 1 (also known as Tan Ce 1, and TC 1) is a Sino-European (CSNA-ESA) satellite that was launched by a Long March 2C/SM rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the Sichuan province of China (PRC) at 19:06 UT on 29 December 2003. The 330 kg, 260 W satellite is cylindrical, with a diameter of 2.1 m, a height of 1.4 m, and spins at a rate of 15 rpm. It carries eight instruments to probe Earth's magnetosphere, five from ESA and three from CNSA. (The ESA instruments are legacies from ESA's Cluster mission.) The data from all instruments will be stored on-board and dumped over three grounds stations: Shanghai and Beifing in China, and Villafranca in Spain. There will be coordination between the Cluster and Double Star missions. For more information, see

                Science Objectives
                ==================
                The Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: an orbiter and an atmospheric probe. The orbiter will be the sixth spacecraft to explore the Jovian magnetosphere, but the first to be placed into orbit around the giant planet. Scientific objectives addressed by the orbiter are to: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.
                
                Spacecraft Overview
                ===================
                
                The structure of the orbiter is divided into two sections. The main body of the spacecraft, comprised of the electronics bays, propellant system, RTG and science booms, and high-gain antenna, rotates at rates of 3.25 or 10.5 rpm. The despun section, aft of the main body, uses an electric motor to drive it counter to the rotation of the main section. This dual spin attitude control system accommodates instruments which require stable, accurate pointing (the imaging instruments) and those which benefit from repetitive, broad-angular coverage (the various particles and fields instruments). The length of the spacecraft is 9 m and, with the high-gain antenna (HGA) deployed, is 4.6 m in diameter.
                
                Power is provided to the spacecraft through the use of two radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs), each of which is located at the end of a short boom. The magnetometer sensors and plasma wave antenna are located on yet another boom, 10.9 m in length.
                
                Although it was intended that communications with the Deep Space Network (DSN) would be primarily through the HGA (which would remain pointing toward the Earth at all times), thermal constraints forced the use of the two low-gain antennas prior to the first Earth flyby. HGA deployment was planned thereafter, but at least three of the HGA &quot;ribs&quot; were unable to be moved much beyond their launch configurations, thereby jeopardizing the total science return of the mission. Several attempts have been made to deploy the antenna through a variety of techniques.

                Mission Overview
                ================
                
                The Galileo mission utilizes a single launch of a combined
                Orbiter and Probe using the space shuttle Atlantis and an
                inertial upper stage (IUS) to inject the Galileo spacecraft
                on its interplanetary trajectory to Jupiter. The launch
                window occurs from October 12, 1989 to November 21, 1989.
                Since the IUS does not have the energy to inject Galileo on
                a direct trajectory to Jupiter, the spacecraft will instead
                be launched first towards Venus for the first leg of its
                Venus-Earth-Earth gravity assist (VEEGA) trajectory to
                Jupiter. Target-of-opportunity science observations will be
                made at Venus (closest approach February 10, 1990), the
                first Earth encounter (closest approach to Earth and Moon
                December 8, 1990), the asteroid Gaspra (closest approach
                October 29, 1991), the second Earth encounter (closest
                approach to Earth and Moon December 8, 1992), and the
                asteroid Ida (closest approach August 28, 1993).
                
                At about 150 days before Galileo arrives at Jupiter, the
                Probe is separated from the Orbiter. From this moment in
                time, the Probe is on a ballistic trajectory to the Probe
                entry point, about 6 degrees north latitude, into the
                atmosphere of Jupiter. Using its 400 Newton engine for the
                first time, the Orbiter executes an Orbiter deflection
                maneuver to keep from following the Probe into the
                atmosphere of Jupiter, and to retarget the Orbiter to the
                proper encounter conditions required for the Jupiter Orbit
                Insertion phase of the mission.
                
                A close flyby (about 1,000 kilometer altitude) of the Jovian
                satellite Io occurs in this phase for the purpose of science
                observations as well as to slow the Orbiter down relative to
                Jupiter by nearly 200 meters/second in order to reduce the
                propellant required during the Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI)
                400 Newton engine burn to capture Galileo into Jupiter's
                orbit. Perijove of about 4 Jupiter radii occurs about 4
                hours after Io encounter. A few minutes after perijove
                passage, the Probe entry and beginning of the relay of data
                from the Probe to the Orbiter occurs.
                
                The Probe mission and data relay lasts 75 minutes, after
                which JOI is performed, slowing the Orbiter down relative to
                Jupiter by about 630 meters/second. The initial orbit period
                is about 200 days. A large 400 Newton engine burn is
                performed at the first apojove in order to raise perijove
                from 4 Jupiter radii to about 9 Jupiter radii, thus allowing
                at least 11 orbits with 10 targeted satellite encounters to
                be completed by the Orbiter without exceeding the allowed
                total accumulated radiation exposure at the spacecraft. Only
                three orbits would be allowed before exceeding this limit if
                perijove were allowed to stay at 4 Jupiter radii, where the
                radiation environment is very severe. Also during this
                perijove raise maneuver, Galileo is targeted to the
                satellite Ganymede, the first of its Galilean satellite
                encounters following JOI.
                
                At this point, the targeting to satellite encounters begins,
                such that a satellite tour consisting of a minimum of 10
                targeted satellite encounters is achieved within the 23
                month period allotted for the satellite tour. During the
                course of the satellite tour, the orientation, shape and
                size of the spacecraft orbits around the Jovian system,
                referred to as petals because of how the spacecraft orbits
                appear on a plan view of the Jovian satellite tour
                trajectory, is controlled almost exclusively by gravity
                assists of the satellites themselves. The orbit periods are
                pumped down by successive encounters with the satellites
                from the initial 200 days to approximately 35-40 days
                between encounters. At the 8th orbit, when the orbit petal
                orientation is approximately in the anti-sun direction, the
                period is again pumped up to about 100 days, allowing one of
                the primary objectives, probing the Jovian magnetotail, to
                be accomplished. After this magnetotail orbit, the period is
                again pumped down, by gravity assist encounters with the
                Jovian satellites, to 35-40 days for the final 2-3 targeted
                encounters.

            <Description>The solar wind draws the Earth's magnetic field into a long tail on the nightside of the Earth and stores energy in the stretched field lines of the magnetotail. During active periods, the tail couples with the near-Earth magnetosphere, sometimes releasing energy stored in the tail and activating auroras in the polar ionosphere.
                The Geotail mission measures global energy flow and transformation in the magnetotail to increase understanding of fundamental magnetospheric processes. This includes the physics of the magnetopause magnetospheric boundary regions, the lobe and plasma sheet, and reconnection and neutral line formation, i.e., the mechanisms processes of input, transport, storage, release and conversion of mass, momentum and energy in the magnetotail.
                Geotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a cooperative scientific satellite project designated the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved understanding of the physics of solar-terrestrial relations.
                Geotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas with a design lifetime of about four years. The nominal spin rate of the spacecraft is about 20 rpm around a spin axis maintained between 85-89 degrees to the ecliptic plane. Geotail is cylindrical, approximately 2.2 m in diameter, and 1.6 m high. with It has body-mounted solar cells. Geotail also has and a back-up battery subsystem which that operates when the spacecraft is in the Earth's shadow (limited to 2 hrs). Real-time telemetry data transmitted in X-band are received at the Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC) in Japan. There are two tape recorders on board, each with a capacity of 450 Mb, which allows daily 24-hour data coverage and are collected in playback mode by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).
                The Geotail mission is divided into two phases. During the two-year initial phase, the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the Moon's gravity in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in the spacecraft spending most of its time in the distant magnetotail (maximum apogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from one to four months. Then, in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers that reduced the apogee to 50 Re. After three more months in the magnetotail the spacecraft was put in a 10 by 30 Re orbit where it has remained except that the perigee was reduced from 10 to 9 Re in June 1997.
                Details on the Geotail mission and instrumentation are given in the Journal of Geomagnetism and Geoelectricity (Vol. 46, No. 1, 1994); online from JGG at http://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/JGG</Description>

            <Description>IMP 8 (IMP-J or Explorer 50), the last satellite of the IMP series, was a drum-shaped spacecraft, 135.6 cm across and 157.4 cm high, instrumented for interplanetary and magnetotail studies of cosmic rays, energetic solar particles, plasma, and electric and magnetic fields. Its initial orbit was more elliptical than intended, with apogee and perigee distances of about 45 and 25 earth radii. Its eccentricity decreased after launch. Its orbital inclination varied between 0 deg and about 55 deg with a periodicity of several years. The spacecraft spin axis was normal to the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 23 rpm. The data telemetry rate was 1600 bps.
                The spacecraft was in the solar wind for 7 to 8 days of every 12.5 day orbit. Telemetry coverage was 90% in the early years, but only 60-70% through most of the 1980's and early 1990's. Coverage returned to the 90% range in the mid to late 1990's.
                The objectives of the extended IMP-8 operations were to provide solar wind parameters as input for magnetospheric studies and as a 1-AU baseline for deep space studies, and to continue solar cycle variation studies with a single set of well-calibrated and understood instruments.
                In October, 2001, IMP 8 was terminated as an independent mission. Telemetry acquisition resumed after about three months at Canberra only (30-50% coverage), as an adjunct to the Voyager and Ulysses missions. As of August 2005 IMP 8 continued in this mode.</Description>

            <Description>The Explorer-class mother spacecraft, International Sun-Earth Explorer 1, was part of the mother/daughter/heliocentric mission (ISEE 1, ISEE 2, ISEE 3). The purposes of the mission were: (1) to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere, (2) to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere, (3) to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets, and (4) to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare effects in the interplanetary region near 1 AU. The three spacecraft carried a number of complementary instruments for making measurements of plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. The mission thus extended the investigations of previous IMP spacecraft. The mother/daughter portion of the mission consisted of two spacecraft (ISEE 1 and ISEE 2) with station-keeping capability in the same highly eccentric geocentric orbit with an apogee of 23 Earth radii. During the course of the mission, the ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 orbit parameters underwent short-term and long-term variations due to solar and lunar perturbations. These two spacecraft maintained a small separation distance, and made simultaneous coordinated measurements to permit separation of spatial from temporal irregularities in the near-Earth solar wind, the bow shock, and inside the magnetosphere. By maneuvering ISEE 2, the inter-spacecraft separation as measured near the Earth's bow shock was allowed to vary between 10 km and 5000 km; its value is accurately known as a function of time and orbital position. The spacecraft were spin stabilized, with the spin vectors maintained nominally within 1 degree of perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, pointing north. The spin rates were nominally 19.75 rpm for ISEE 1 and 19.8 rpm for ISEE 2, so that there was a slow differential rotation between the two spacecraft. The ISEE 1 body-mounted solar array provided approximately 175 watts initially and 131 watts after three years, at 28 volts during normal operation. The ISEE 1 data rate was 4096 bps most of the time and 16384 bps during one orbit out of every five (with some exceptions). Both ISEE 1 and ISEE 2 re-entered the Earth's atmosphere during orbit 1518 on September 26, 1987. Seventeen of 21 on-board experiments were operational at the end.

            <Description>The Interball Project is a multi-national effort that consists of four spacecraft: two main spacecraft of the Prognoz series, made in Russia, each with a small subsatellite made in Czechoslovakia. The main objective is to study the physical mechanisms responsible for the transmission of solar wind energy to the magnetosphere, its storage there, and subsequent dissipation in the tail and auroral regions of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere during magnetospheric substorms. A ground-based support group will provide coordinated and simultaneous ground-based data of many types, including observations from auroral and polar cap regions. Interball is an IACG-related mission. Key physical parameters will be generated, and will be available for exchange with other projects. Campaigns for intercomparison with the Wind and Geotail spacecraft are expected. One pair of spacecraft, Tail Probe and its subsatellite S2-X (X for the first letter of the Russian word for ``Tail''), will be launched into the magnetospheric tail. The second pair, Auroral Probe and S2-A (A for ``Auroral''), will have an orbit that crosses the auroral oval to observe the acceleration of auroral particles and the flow of electric currents that connect the magnetospheric tail with the conducting ionosphere. To study the equilibrium tail structure, during about half of each year the Tail Probe pair will cross the main parts of the magnetotail every four days. The Tail Probe, with approximately 30 earth radii apogee, will cross the noon-midnight plane on December 1, so the measurements in the magnetotail will cover the period from October 1995 to February 1996. The Auroral Probe pair will support the Tail Probe pair with auroral region measurements.
                
                Each main spacecraft has more than twenty scientific instruments. The spacecraft is cylindrical, with spin axis toward the sun (within 10 degrees), and with spin period of ~120 s. The electric and magnetic field sensors are on booms connected to the ends of the solar panels.
                
                The subsatellites are small, each with about ten scientific instruments. The spin axis will be directed within 10 degrees of the sun, with a spin period of ~120 s, as with the main spacecraft. The subsatellites also carry gas-jet thrusters for limited control of the orbit. Separation distance will range from hundreds of kilometers to several tens of thousands of kilometers for the Tail Probe pair. Separation distance will range from hundreds of meters to hundreds of kilometers for the Auroral Probe pair. The Tail Probe has two telemetry systems, at up to 32 Kbps in real-time, with a memory mode capacity of 30 Mb in the RTK telemetry system and 120 Mb in the SSNI system. The Auroral Probe has similar capability plus the additional real-time-only STO system, capable of 40 Kbps. Each subsatellite has only the STO real-time telemetry system. For S2-X the rate can be varied from 2--40 kbps.
                
                The Tail Probe has an adapting alert mode while in the memory mode, allowing time resolutions that are the same as in the real-time mode. The aim is to have the highest time resolution available at the thin borders of magnetospheric regions or the sharp borders of some features. In the alert mode (triggered by an on-board computer monitoring plasma and field parameters), the bit rate is increased for plasma, field, and wave measurements. The duration of these alert periods is about 10 minutes, and there can be 5--6 of them during one orbit.</Description>

            <Description>ESA's Mars Express mission was launched 02-June-2003 
                and arrived at Mars in December, 2003.  A lander, Beagle 2, was deployed
                on 19-Dec-2003, but communication was lost prior to any science data
                capture.  The main spacecraft went into a polar orbit on 25-Dec-2003, with
                apogee and perigee altitudes of 11,634 km and 279 km (3.4 and 0.08 Martian
                radii).  The scientific objectives of the 3-axis-stabilized Mars Express 
                Orbiter are to obtain global high-resolution photo-geology (10 m resolution), 
                mineralogical mapping (100 m resolution) and mapping of the atmospheric 
                composition, study the subsurface structure, the global atmospheric 
                circulation, and the interaction between the atmosphere and the subsurface, 
                and the atmosphere and the interplanetary medium.</Description>

            <Description>The Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry 
                and Ranging (MESSENGER) mission, launched on 2004-08-03, was mainly
                designed to study the characteristics and environment of Mercury from 
                orbit.  After an Earth flyby July-August, 2005, Venus flybys October-
                November, 2006, and May-June, 2007, and Mercury flybys December 2007 - 
                January 2008, September-October, 2008, and September-October, 2009, 
                MESSENGER entered Mercury orbit 2011-03-04.  Much data of interest to
                the heliospheric community was obtained during the cruise phases
                between planetary encounters from a magnetometer and an energetic 
                particle and plasma spectrometer.</Description>

            <Description>The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbited Mars over a seven year period and collected data on the surface morphology, topography, composition, gravity, atmospheric dynamics, and magnetic field. This data is used to investigate the surface processes, geology, distribution of material, internal properties, evolution of the magnetic field, and the weather and climate of Mars.
                
                Spacecraft and Subsystems
                
                The spacecraft itself is a rectangular box approximately 1.17 x 1.17 x 1.7 meters in size, made up of two parts, the equipment module and the propulsion module. All instruments except the magnetometer are stored on the nadir equipment deck, on one of the 1.17 x 1.17 meter surfaces. This is the top of the equipment module, which is 0.735 m high. The main thruster and propulsion tanks are on the opposite side from the instruments, on the propulsion module, which is approximately 1 meter high. Two solar panels, each 3.5 x 1.9 m in size, extend out from opposite sides of the craft. A 1.5 meter diameter parabolic high gain dish antenna is mounted on an adjacent side, and attached to a 2 meter boom, which is extended for mapping operations so the antenna is held away from the body of the spacecraft.
                
                The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized with no scan platform. The main 596 N thruster used hydrazine and N2O4 propellant. Control is through 12 4.45 N hydrazine thrusters, mounted in four groups of three (two aft facing and one roll control thruster). The initial propellant load was 216.5 kg of hydrazine and 144 kg of N2O4. Four solar array panels (2 GaAs, 2 SI) provided 980 W of power to the spacecraft. Energy was stored in two 20 Amp-hr nickel hydrogen batteries, and supplied at 28 V DC. Temperature control was primarily passive with multilayer insulation, thermal radiators, and louvers, augmented by electrical heaters. Communications was achieved via the deep space network using the high gain antenna and two low gain antennas, one mounted on the high gain antenna and one on the equipment module. Uplink was in the X-band, downlink in the X and Ka bands. Minimum downlink rate was 21.33 kbps, 2 kbps engineering data downlink, and 10 bps emergency downlink.
                
                The instruments on the nadir equipment deck consist of a camera, thermal emission spectrometer, laser altimeter, and a radio transmission relay. A magnetometer/electron reflectometer sensor is attached to the end of each solar array, and an ultra-stable oscillator is used for tracking and gravity determination. An 8086 processor is used for the payload data subsystem, and 1750A processors for the standard controls processor and the engineering data formatter. Data is stored on four 0.75 Gb solid state recorders.
                
                Mission Profile
                
                After launch on a Delta 7925 (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with nine strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 48 (PAM-D) third stage) and a 10 month cruise phase, the Mars Global Surveyor was inserted into an elliptical capture orbit at 01:17 UT 12 September 1997. Over the next four months, it was intended that aerobraking maneuvers and thrusters would be used to lower the orbit to the final circular mapping orbit. However, one of the solar panels failed to latch properly when it was deployed and subsequently showed unexpected motion and moved past its fully deployed position when aerobraking began (thought to be due to the fracture of a damper arm and subsequent structural damage). A new aerobraking schedule was employed, which involved slower aerobraking putting less pressure on the solar panels through April 1998, at which time an 11.6 hour science phasing orbit with a 171 km periapsis was achieved and aerobraking was halted. After a 5 month hiatus, aerobraking was resumed on 23 September 1998. Science observations were made periodically during these maneuvers.
                
                After aerobraking ended in February 1999, MGS was in a 118 minute circular polar science mapping orbit with an index altitude of 378 km. The orbit is sun-synchronous (2 a.m./2 p.m.) and maps over the 2 p.m. crossing from south to north (instead of north to south as originally planned). The orbit has a 7 day near-repeat cycle so Mars will be mapped in 26 day cycles. Science mapping began in mid-March 1999, which was summer in the northern hemisphere on Mars. The primary mission lasted one martian year (687 Earth days) through January, 2001. An extended mission took place until April 2002, further extensions were added until contact with the spacecraft was lost on 2 November 2006.</Description>

            <Description>The OMNI observatory is a virtual observatory representing the collection of spacecraft used in the creation of the OMNI datasets.  
                The observatories used within the OMNI datasets are ACE, Wind, IMP8, Geotail, GOES and various other spacecraft. For any given time period 
                OMNI uses a selection criteria to select the &quot;best&quot; available data to be used.  Thus, a data record may consist of data from multiple
                observatories.  Without looking at each data record it is not possible to tell which observatories contributed. As result, the OMNI 
                observatories is used as a proxy for the set of possible contributing observatories. Complete details on the instruments and the 
                selection criteria are available at the Information URLs listed below.</Description>

            <Description>This mission was the first to be sent to the outer solar system and the first to investigate the planet Jupiter, after which it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system. The spacecraft achieved its closest approach to Jupiter on December 3, 1973, when it reached approximately 2.8 Jovian radii (about 200,000 km). As of Jan. 1, 1997 Pioneer 10 was at about 67 AU from the Sun near the ecliptic plane and heading outward from the Sun at 2.6 AU/year and downstream through the heliomagnetosphere towards the tail region and interstellar space. This solar system escape direction is unique because the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft (and the now terminated Pioneer 11 spacecraft mission) are heading in the opposite direction towards the nose of the heliosphere in the upstream direction relative to the inflowing interstellar gas. The spacecraft is heading generally towards the red star Aldebaran, which forms the eye of Taurus (The Bull). The journey over a distance of 68 light years to Aldebaran will require about two million years to complete. Routine tracking and project data processing operatations were terminated on March 31, 1997 for budget reasons. Occasional tracking continued later under support of the Lunar Prospector project at NASA Ames Research Center with retrieval of energetic particle and radio science data. The last successful data acquisitions through NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) occurred on March 3, 2002, the 30th anniversary of Pioneer 10's launch date, and on April 27, 2002. The spacecraft signal was last detected on Jan. 23, 2003 after an uplink was transmitted to turn off the last operational experiment, the Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT), but lock-on to the sub-carrier signal for data downlink was not achieved. No signal at all was detected during a final attempt on Feb. 6-7, 2003. Pioneer Project staff at NASA Ames then concluded that the spacecraft power level had fallen below that needed to power the onboard transmitter, so no further attempts would be made.
                
                The history of the Pioneer 10 tracking status is available from the web site of the former Pioneer Project at the following location:
                
                http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.html
                
                Fifteen experiments were carried to study the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields; solar wind parameters; cosmic rays; transition region of the heliosphere; neutral hydrogen abundance; distribution, size, mass, flux, and velocity of dust particles; Jovian aurorae; Jovian radio waves; atmosphere of Jupiter and some of its satellites, particularly Io; and to photograph Jupiter and its satellites. Instruments carried for these experiments were magnetometer, plasma analyzer, charged particle detector, ionizing detector, non-imaging telescopes with overlapping fields of view to detect sunlight reflected from passing meteoroids, sealed pressurized cells of argon and nitrogen gas for measuring the penetration of meteoroids, UV photometer, IR radiometer, and an imaging photopolarimeter, which produced photographs and measured polarization. Further scientific information was obtained from the tracking and occultation data.
                
                The spacecraft body was mounted behind a 2.74-m-diameter parabolic dish antenna that was 46 cm deep. The spacecraft structure was a 36-cm-deep flat equipment compartment, the top and bottom being regular hexagons. Its sides were 71 cm long. One side joined a smaller compartment that carried the scientific experiments. The high-gain antenna feed was situated on three struts, which projected forward about 1.2 m. This feed was topped with a medium-gain antenna. A low-gain omnidirectional antenna extended about 0.76 m behind the equipment compartment and was mounted below the high-gain antenna. Power for the spacecraft was obtained by four SNAP-19 radioisotope thermonuclear generators (RTG), which were held about 3 m from the center of the spacecraft by two three-rod trusses 120 deg apart. A third boom extended 6.6 m from the experiment compartment to hold the magnetometer away from the spacecraft. The four RTG's generated about 155 W at launch and decayed to approximately 140 W by the time the spacecraft reached Jupiter, 21 months after launch. There were three reference sensors: a star sensor for Canopus which failed shortly after Jupiter encounter and two sun sensors. Attitude position could be calculated from the reference directions to the earth and the sun, with the known direction to Canopus as a backup. Three pairs of rocket thrusters provided spin-rate control and changed the velocity of the spacecraft, the spin period near the end of the mission being 14.1 seconds. These thrusters could be pulsed or fired steadily by command. The spacecraft was temperature-controlled between minus 23 deg C and plus 38 deg C. A plaque was mounted on the spacecraft body with drawings depicting a man, a woman, and the location of the sun and the earth in our galaxy.
                
                Communications were maintained via (1) the omnidirectional and medium-gain antennas which operated together while connected to one receiver and (2) the high-gain antenna which was connected to another receiver. These receivers could be interchanged by command to provide some redundancy. Two radio transmitters, coupled to two traveling-wave tube amplifiers, produced 8 W at 2292 MHz each. Uplink was accomplished at 2110 MHz, while data transmission downlink was at 2292 MHz. The data were received by NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) at bit rates up to 2048 bps enroute to Jupiter and at 16 bps near end of the mission.
                
                Space experiments mostly continued to operate for planetary or interplanetary measurements until failure or until insufficient spacecraft power from the RTG's was available for operation of all instruments, such that some were turned off permanently and others were cycled on and off in accordance with a power sharing plan implemented in September 1989. The Asteroid/Meteroid Detector failed in December 1973, followed by the Helium Vector Magnetometer (HVM) in November 1975 and the Infrared Radiometer in January 1974. The Meteroid Detector was turned off in October 1980 due to inactive sensors at low temperatures. The spacecraft sun sensors became inoperative in May 1986, and the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) instrument was used to obtain roll phase and spin period information until being turned off in October 1993 to conserve power. The Trapped Radiation Detector (TRD) and Plasma Analyzer (PA) were respectively turned off in November 1993 and September 1995 for the same reason. As of January 1996 the final power cycling plan included part-time operations of the Charged Particle Instrument (CPI), the Cosmic Ray Telescope (CRT), the Geiger Tube Telescope (GTT), and the Ultraviolet Photometer (UV). As of August 2000, only the GTT instrument was still returning data.
                
                Various other spacecraft subsystems also either failed or were turned off for power or other reasons, and an account of these may be of interest for engineering design of long duration deep space missions. The primary antenna feed offset bellows failed sometime in 1976 but a redundant unit was available for use thereafter. The Program Storage and Execution (PSE) subsystem was turned off in September 1989 for power conservation, after which spacecraft maneuvers were performed by ground command sequences. A receiver problem in mid-1992 prevented uplink to the high gain antenna, after which uplink commands could only be sent with 70-meter DSN antennas which also supported the 16 bps downlink. The Backup Line Heater experienced a sticking thermostat operation in March 1993 for 30 days but the problem did not reoccur. Undervoltage Protection Logic was turned off in December 1993 to prevent loss of critical spacecraft systems in the event of a transient undervoltage condition. Duration and Steering Logic (DSL) was turned off in February 1995 to conserve power, after which it was turned on again only for spacecraft maneuvers. RTG power levels are low enough that the spacecraft occasionally relies in part on battery power (accumulated during inactive periods) to run experiments and other systems.
                
                The total mission cost for Pioneer 10 through the 1997 end of official science operations was about 350 million in FY 2001 U.S. dollars. This included about 200 million dollars for pre-launch design and development, and another 150 million for launch, telemetry tracking, mission operations and data analysis. These estimates were provided by the former Pioneer Project at NASA Ames Research Center.</Description>

Pioneer 11, like Pioneer 10, used Jupiter's gravitational field to alter its trajectory radically. It passed close to Saturn and then it followed an escape trajectory from the solar system.
                
                The spacecraft was 2.9 m long and contained a 2.74-m diameter high-gain antenna of aluminum honeycomb sandwich material whose feed was topped with a medium-gain antenna. A low-gain, omnidirectional antenna was mounted below the high-gain dish. The spacecraft contained two nuclear electric-power generators, which generated 144 W at Jupiter, but decreased to 100 W at Saturn. There were three reference sensors: a star (Canopus) sensor, and two sun sensors. Attitude position could be calculated from the reference direction to the earth and the sun, with the known direction to Canopus as backup. Pioneer 11's star sensor gain and threshold settings were modified, based on experience gained from the settings used on Pioneer 10. Three pairs of rocket thrusters provided spin-axis control (maintained at 4.8 rpm) and change of the spacecraft velocity. The thrusters could be either fired steadily or pulsed, by command.
                
                Communications were maintained via the omnidirectional and medium-gain antennas, which operated together, connected to one receiver, while the high-gain antenna was connected to the other receiver. The receivers could be interchanged by command. Two radio transmitters, coupled to two traveling-wave tube amplifiers, produced 8 W power each in S-band. Communication uplink (earth to spacecraft) operated at 2110 MHz, and downlink (spacecraft to earth) at 2292 MHz. At Jupiter's distance, round-trip communication time took 92 min. Data were received at the Deep Space Network (DSN). The spacecraft was temperature-controlled to between -23 and +38 deg C (-10 to +100 deg F). An additional experiment, a low-sensitivity fluxgate magnetometer, was added to the Pioneer 11 payload.
                
                Instruments studied the interplanetary and planetary magnetic fields; solar wind properties; cosmic rays; transition region of the heliosphere; neutral hydrogen abundance; distribution, size, mass, flux, and velocity of dust particles; Jovian aurorae; Jovian radio waves; the atmospheres of planets and satellites; and the surfaces of Jupiter, Saturn, and some of their satellites. Instruments carried for these experiments were magnetometer, plasma analyzer (for solar wind), charged-particle detector, ionizing detector, non-imaging telescopes with overlapping fields of view to detect sunlight reflected from passing meteoroids, sealed pressurized cells of argon and nitrogen gas for measuring penetration of meteoroids, UV photometer, IR radiometer, and an imaging photopolarimeter, which produced photographs and measured the polarization. Further scientific information was obtained from celestial mechanics and occultation phenomena.
                
                This spacecraft, like Pioneer 10, contains a plaque that has a drawing depicting man, woman, and the location of the sun and earth in the galaxy.
                
                During its closest approach, December 4, 1974, Pioneer 11 passed to within 34,000 km of Jupiter's cloud tops. It passed by Saturn on September 1, 1979, at a distance of 21,000 km from Saturn's cloud tops. The spacecraft has operated on a backup transmitter since launch. Instrument power sharing began in February 1985 due to declining RTG power output. Science operations and daily telemetry ceased on September 30, 1995 when the RTG power level was insufficient to operate any experiments. As of the end of 1995 the spacecraft was located at 44.7 AU from the Sun at a nearly asymptotic latitude of 17.4 degrees above the solar equatorial plane and was heading outward at 2.5 AU/year.</Description>

            <Description>The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was the first of a two-spacecraft orbiter-probe combination designed to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the atmosphere of Venus. The spacecraft was a solar-powered cylinder about 250 cm in diameter with its spin axis spin-stabilized perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. A high-gain antenna was mechanically despun to remain focused on the earth. The instruments were mounted on a shelf within the spacecraft except for a magnetometer mounted at the end of a boom to ensure against magnetic interference from the spacecraft. Pioneer Venus Orbiter measured the detailed structure of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere of Venus, investigated the interaction of the solar wind with the ionosphere and the magnetic field in the vicinity of Venus, determined the characteristics of the atmosphere and surface of Venus on a planetary scale, determined the planet's gravitational field harmonics from perturbations of the spacecraft orbit, and detected gamma-ray bursts. UV observations of comets have also been made. From Venus orbit insertion on December 4, 1978 to July 1980 periapsis was held between 142 and 253 km to facilitate radar and ionospheric measurements. Thereafter, the periapsis was allowed to rise (to 2290 km at maximum) and then fall, to conserve fuel. In 1991 the Radar Mapper was reactivated to investigate previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet. In May 1992 Pioneer Venus began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis was held between 150 and 250 km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry destroyed the spacecraft the following August. The orbiter cost $125 million to build and operate for the first 10 years. For further details see Colin, L. and Hunten, D. M., Space Science Reviews 20, 451, 1977.</Description>

            <Description>POLAR is one of four spacecraft in the Global Geospace Science (GGS) program. These are among the six spacecraft in the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program. POLAR provides multi-wavelength imaging of the aurora, measuring plasma entry into the polar magnetosphere and geomagnetic tail, the flow of plasmas to and from the ionosphere, and the deposition of particle energy in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. POLAR has on-board propulsion systems and a design lifetime of three to five years, with redundant subsystems. POLAR is cylindrical, approximately 2.8 m in diameter by 1.25 m high (plus 1.25 m for its two despun platforms), with body-mounted solar cells, weighs 1250 kg and uses 333 W of power. The spin rate is 10 rpm around an axis approximately normal to the orbital plane. It has long wire spin-plane antennas, inertial booms, and spin-plane appendages to support sensors. POLAR has two despun gimbaled instrument platforms, and booms are deployed along both Z axes. Data are stored using on-board tape recorders and are relayed to the Deep Space Network at 600 kbps maximum (250 kbps nominal) although the average real-time data rate for POLAR is 41.6 kbps. POLAR has a 22.6-h polar orbit (90 deg inclination), with perigee and apogee of 11,500 and 57,000 km. Polar was launched to observe the polar magnetosphere and, as its orbit has precessed with time, has observed the equatorial inner magnetosphere and is now carrying out an extended period of southern hemisphere coverage. Details on the POLAR mission and instrumentation are provided in Space Science Reviews (Vol. 71, Nos. 1-4, 1995) and reprinted in The Global Geospace Mission, edited by C. T. Russell (Kluwer, 1995).</Description>

            <Description>The Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission includes two spacecraft respectively lagging (STEREO A) and leading (STEREO B) the Earth in heliocentric orbit around the Sun for remote 3-D imaging and radio observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events are responsible for large solar energetic particle events in interplanetary space and are the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms at Earth. The two spacecraft are launched to drift slowly away from the Earth in opposite directions at about 10 degrees per year for the lagging spacecraft and 20 degrees per year for the leading one. Optimal longitudinal separation of about sixty degrees is achieved after two years. Afterwards the separation gradually increases beyond the design lifetime of two years with the possibility of extended mission observations at larger angles. Science instruments selected for STEREO include the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), white-light coronographic, and heliospheric imaging, the STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) interplanetary radio burst tracker, the In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation for in-situ sampling the 3-D distribution and plasma characteristics of solar energetic particles and the interplanetary magnetic field, and the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment to measure elemental and charge composition of ambient and CME plasma ions. STEREO data recorded and stored onboard each spacecraft will be downlinked through the NASA Deep Space Network on a daily schedule. Real-time space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations.</Description>

            <Description>The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is a five-satellite Explorer mission whose primary objective is to understand the onset and macroscale evolution of magnetospheric substorms. Most importantly, THEMIS will find out which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset: (a) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current; or, (b) that current's interaction with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from lobe flux annihilation at ~25Re. Three inner probes at ~10Re will monitor current disruption onset, while two outer probes, at 20 and 30Re respectively, will remotely monitor plasma acceleration due to lobe flux dissipation. The five small satellites were launched together on a Delta II rocket and they carry identical sets of instruments including an electric field instrument (EFI), a flux gate magnetometer (FGM), a search coil magnetometer (SCM), a electro-static analyzer, and solid state telescopes (SST). The mission consists of several phases. In the first phase, the spacecraft will all orbit as a tight cluster in the same orbital plane with apogee at 15.4 Earth radii (RE). In the second phase, also called the Dawn Phase, the satellites will be placed in their orbits and during this time their apogees will be on the dawn side of the magnetosphere. During the third phase (also known as the Tail Science Phase) the apogees will be in the magnetotail. The fourth phase is called the Dusk Phase or Radiation Belt Science Phase, with all apogees on the dusk side. In the fifth and final phase, the apogees will shift to the sunward side (Dayside Science Phase).
                
                All five satellites will have similar perigee altitudes (1.16-1.5 Re) but varying apogee altitudes (P1: ~30 RE, P2: ~20 RE, P3 &amp; P4: ~12 RE, P5: ~10RE) with corresponding orbital periods of ~4, 2, and 1 days, respectively. This results in multi-point magnetic conjunctions. Every four days the satellites will line up along the Earth's magnetic tail with magnetic foot points in the North American sector, allowing the tracking of disturbances through different geospace regions from tail to ground.
                
                The satellite data will be combined with observations of the aurora from a network of 20 ground observatories (all sky imagers, magnetometers) across the North American continent. In addition to its primary goal, THEMIS will answer critical questions in radiation belt physics and solar wind - magnetosphere energy coupling. THEMIS is complementary to MMS in terms of the temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena observed by these two constellation missions. THEMIS's focus is macroscale, whereas MMS will observe micro/meso scale features. </Description>

In the second phase, also called the Dawn Phase, the satellites will be placed in their orbits and during this time their apogees will be on the dawn side of the magnetosphere. During the third phase (also known as the Tail Science Phase) the apogees will be in the magnetotail. The fourth phase is called the Dusk Phase or Radiation Belt Science Phase, with all apogees on the dusk side. In the fifth and final phase, the apogees will shift to the sunward side (Dayside Science Phase).
                
                All five satellites will have similar perigee altitudes (1.16-1.5 Re) but varying apogee altitudes (P1: ~30 RE, P2: ~20 RE, P3 &amp; P4: ~12 RE, P5: ~10RE) with corresponding orbital periods of ~4, 2, and 1 days, respectively. This results in multi-point magnetic conjunctions. Every four days the satellites will line up along the Earth's magnetic tail with magnetic foot points in the North American sector, allowing the tracking of disturbances through different geospace regions from tail to ground.
                
                The satellite data will be combined with observations of the aurora from a network of 20 ground observatories (all sky imagers, magnetometers) across the North American continent. In addition to its primary goal, THEMIS will answer critical questions in radiation belt physics and solar wind - magnetosphere energy coupling. THEMIS is complementary to MMS in terms of the temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena observed by these two constellation missions. THEMIS's focus is macroscale, whereas MMS will observe micro/meso scale features. </Description>

            <Description>The Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mission is a five-satellite Explorer mission whose primary objective is to understand the onset and macroscale evolution of magnetospheric substorms. Most importantly, THEMIS will find out which magnetotail process is responsible for substorm onset: (a) a local disruption of the plasma sheet current; or, (b) that current's interaction with the rapid influx of plasma emanating from lobe flux annihilation at ~25Re. Three inner probes at ~10Re will monitor current disruption onset, while two outer probes, at 20 and 30Re respectively, will remotely monitor plasma acceleration due to lobe flux dissipation. The five small satellites were launched together on a Delta II rocket and they carry identical sets of instruments including an electric field instrument (EFI), a flux gate magnetometer (FGM), a search coil magnetometer (SCM), a electro-static analyzer, and solid state telescopes (SST).

            <Description>The primary objectives of Ulysses, formerly the International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM), are to investigate, as a function of solar latitude, the properties of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field, of galactic cosmic rays and neutral interstellar gas, and to study energetic particle composition and acceleration. The 55 kg payload includes two magnetometers, two solar wind plasma instruments, a unified radio/plasma wave instrument, three energetic charged particle instruments, an interstellar neutral gas sensor, a solar X-ray/cosmic gamma-ray burst detector, and a cosmic dust sensor. The communications systems is also used to study the solar corona and to search for gravitational waves. Secondary objectives included interplanetary and planetary physics investigations during the initial Earth-Jupiter phase and investigations in the Jovian magnetosphere. The spacecraft used a Jupiter swingby in Feb. 1992 to transfer to a heliospheric orbit with high heliocentric inclination, and will pass over the rotational south pole of the sun in mid-1994 at 2 AU, and over the north pole in mid-1995. A second solar orbit will take Ulysses again over the south and north poles in years 2000 and 2001, respectively. The spacecraft is powered by a single radio-isotope generator. It is spin stabilized at a rate of 5 rpm and its high-gain antenna points continuously to the earth. A nutation anomaly after launch was controlled by CONSCAN. The original mission planned for two spacecraft, one built by ESA and the other by NASA. NASA cancelled its spacecraft in 1981.</Description>

            <Description>Voyager 1 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.
                
                Spacecraft and Subsystems
                
                Each Voyager consisted of a decahedral bus, 47 cm in height and 1.78 m across from flat to flat. A 3.66 m diameter parabolic high-gain antenna was mounted on top of the bus. The major portion of the science instruments were mounted on a science boom extending out some 2.5 m from the spacecraft. At the end of the science boom was a steerable scan platform on which were mounted the imaging and spectroscopic remote sensing instruments. Also mounted at various distances along the science boom were the plasma and charged particle detectors. The magnetometers were located along a separate boom extending 13 m on the side opposite the science boom. A third boom, extending down and away from the science instruments, held the spacecraft's radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Two 10 m whip antennas (used for the plasma wave and planetary radio astronomy investigations) also extended from the spacecraft, each perpendicular to the other. The spacecraft was three-axis spin stabilized to enable long integration times and selective viewing for the instruments mounted on the scan platform.
                
                Power was provided to the spacecraft systems and instruments through the use of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The RTGs were assembled in tandem on a deployable boom hinged on an outrigger arrangement of struts attached to the basic structure. Each RTG unit, contained in a beryllium outer case, was 40.6 cm in diameter, 50.8 cm in length, and weighed 39 kg. The RTGs used a radioactive source (Plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium oxide, or PuO2, in this case) which, as it decayed, gave off heat. A bi-metallic thermoelectric device was used to convert the heat to electric power for the spacecraft. The total output of RTGs slowly decreases with time as the radioactive material is expended. Therefore, although the initial output of the RTGs on Voyager was approximately 470 W of 30 V DC power at launch, it had fallen off to approximately 335 W by the beginning of 1997 (about 19.5 years post-launch). As power continues to decrease, power loads on the spacecraft must also decrease. Current estimates (1998) are that increasingly limited instrument operations can be carried out at least until 2020.
                
                Communications were provided through the high-gain antenna with a low-gain antenna for backup. The high-gain antenna supported both X-band and S-band downlink telemetry. Voyager was the first spacecraft to utilize X-band as the primary telemetry link frequency. Data could be stored for later transmission to Earth through the use of an on-board digital tape recorder.
                
                Voyager, because of its distance from Earth and the resulting time-lag for commanding, was designed to operate in a highly-autonomous manner. In order to do this and carry out the complex sequences of spacecraft motions and instrument operations, three interconnected on-board computers were utilized. The Computer Command Subsystem (CCS) was responsible for storing commanding for the other two computers and issuing the commands at set times. The Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) was responsible for controlling spacecraft attitude and motions of the scan platform. The Flight Data Subsystem (FDS) controlled the instruments, including changes in configuration (state) or telemetry rates. All three computers had redundant components to ensure continued operations. The AACS included redundant star trackers and Sun sensors as well.

                Each Voyager has mounted to one of the sides of the bus a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk. The disk has recorded on it sounds and images of Earth designed to portray the diversity of life and culture on the planet. Each disk is encased in a protective aluminum jacket along with a cartridge and a needle. Instructions explaining from where the spacecraft originated and how to play the disk are engraved onto the jacket. Electroplated onto a 2 cm area on the cover is also an ultra-pure source of uranium-238 (with a radioactivity of about 0.26 nanocuries and a half-life of 4.51 billion years), allowing the determination of the elapsed time since launch by measuring the amount of daughter elements to remaining U238. The 115 images on the disk were encoded in analog form. The sound selections (including greetings in 55 languages, 35 sounds, natural and man-made, and portions of 27 musical pieces) are designed for playback at 1000 rpm. The Voyagers were not the first spacecraft designed with such messages to the future. Pioneers 10 and 11, LAGEOS, and the Apollo landers also included plaques with a similar intent, though not quite so ambitious.
                
                Mission Profile
                
                Originally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.
                
                Originally scheduled to launch twelve days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's launch was delayed twice to prevent the occurrence of problems which Voyager 2 experienced after launch. Voyager 1's launch finally happened on 05 Sept. 1977 and was termed &quot;flawless and accurate&quot;.
                
                Although launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun. Voyager 1 then proceeded to Jupiter (making its closest approach on 05 March 1979) and Saturn (with closest approach on 12 Nov. 1980). Both prior to and after planetary encounters observations were made of the interplanetary medium. Some 18,000 images of Jupiter and its satellites were taken by Voyager 1. In addition, roughly 16,000 images of Saturn, its rings and satellites were obtained.
                
                After its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 remained relatively quiescent, continuing to make in situ observations of the interplanetary environment and UV observations of stars. After nearly nine years of dormancy, Voyager 1's cameras were once again turned on to take a series of pictures. On 14 Feb. 1990, Voyager 1 looked back from whence it came and took the first &quot;family portrait&quot; of the solar system, a mosaic of 60 frames of the Sun and six of the planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) as seen from &quot;outside&quot; the solar system. After this final look back, the cameras on Voyager 1 were once again turned off.
                
                All of the experiments, save the photopolarimeter (which failed to operate), have produced useful data.
                
                Onward and Outward
                
                Rechristened the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) by NASA in 1989 (after Voyager 2's Neptune encounter), Voyager 1 continues operations, taking measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field, plasma, and charged particle environment while searching for the heliopause (the distance at which the solar wind becomes subsumed by the more general interstellar wind). Through the end of the Neptune phase of the Voyager project, a total of $875 million had been expended for the construction, launch, and operations of both Voyager spacecraft. An additional $30 million was allocated for the first two years of VIM.
                
                Voyager 1 is speeding away from the Sun at a velocity of about 3.50 AU/year toward a point in the sky of RA= 262 degrees, Dec=+12 degrees (35.55 degrees ecliptic latitude, 260.78 degrees ecliptic longitude). Late on 17 February 1998, Voyager 1 became the most distant man-made object from the Sun, surpassing the distance of Pioneer 10.</Description>

            <Description>Voyager 2 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.
                
                Spacecraft and Subsystems
                
                Each Voyager consisted of a decahedral bus, 47 cm in height and 1.78 m across from flat to flat. A 3.66 m diameter parabolic high-gain antenna was mounted on top of the bus. The major portion of the science instruments were mounted on a science boom extending out some 2.5 m from the spacecraft. At the end of the science boom was a steerable scan platform on which were mounted the imaging and spectroscopic remote sensing instruments. Also mounted at various distances along the science boom were the plasma and charged particle detectors. The magnetometers were located along a separate boom extending 13 m on the side opposite the science boom.

The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.
                
                Voyager 2 was the first of the two spacecraft to be launched, with liftoff occurring 20 Aug. 1977. What was at first an auspicious launch, however, proved to be the beginning of a number of problems. The primary cause of the initial problems were attributed to commanding by the AACS, including difficulty in determining the full deployment of the science boom. These problems resulted in a delay of four days in the launch of Voyager 1 to ensure they wouldn't occur for it.
                
                Although launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun.
                
                Several months after launch, in April 1978, Voyager 2's primary radio receiver failed, automatically kicking in the backup receiver which proved to be faulty. Attempts to recover the use of the primary receiver failed and the backup receiver was used for the remainder of the mission. Although use of the backup receiver made communication with the spacecraft more difficult, engineers were able to find workarounds.
                
                Voyager 2 proceeded with its primary mission and flew by Jupiter (closest approach on 09 July 1979) and Saturn (05 Aug. 1981). During these flybys, Voyager 2 obtained images roughly equal in number to Voyager 1 (18,000 at Jupiter, 16,000 at Saturn).
                
                Voyager 2's launch date had preserved one part of the original Grand Tour design, i.e. the possibility of an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune. Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus (24 Jan. 1986) and Neptune (25 Aug. 1989). Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.
                
                All of the experiments on Voyager 2 have produced useful data.

Through the end of the Neptune phase of the Voyager project, a total of $875 million had been expended for the construction, launch, and operations of both Voyager spacecraft. An additional $30 million was allocated for the first two years of VIM.

            <Description>The ACE Magnetometer (MAG) experiment consists of two triaxial fluxgate magnetometers mounted remotely on booms extending beyond the spacecraft solar panels at four meters from the spacecraft center. Each identical sensor (M1, M2) has a wide dynamic range of sensitivity at +- 0.004 to +- 65536 nT and measures the three vector components of the magnetic field. Usage of twin magnetometer sensors for measurements of weak interplanetary magnetic fields is a proven approach based on experience from many past space missions. The MAG sensors were originally built as spares for the MFI instrument on the Wind spacecraft and have been given minor modifications for inclusion on ACE. Readout of MAG data includes three data types: (1) average magnetic field vectors from the primary and secondary sensors, (2) &quot;Snap-Shot Memory&quot; data, and (3) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) data. The average vector readout includes 216 bps corresponding to six vectors per second. These vector readouts can be split between M1 and M2 in the ratios of 3:3, 5:1, or 6:0. The &quot;Snap-Shot Memory&quot; stores field vectors at the maximum sampling rate of 30 vectors per second and is read out at 48 bps. The FFT readout includes 17 seconds accumulation of vector data transformed into spectral matrices of the components and total magnitude at a transmission rate of 32 bps. Prof. Norman F. Ness of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware is the MAG Experiment Manager.</Description>

            <Description>The Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) instrument sensors measure solar wind electrons at 1 - 900 eV energy and ions at 0.26 - 35 keV. The instrument consists of separate electron and ion analyzers originally built as spares for the Ulysses mission. The two sensors both utilizes curved-plate electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) consisting of spherical sections cut into sectors. Biased channel electron multipliers (CEMS) are spaced along the exit apertures of the ESAs for ion and electron detection. Different CEMs sample different portions of the fan-shaped fields of view. The ion sensor consists of a 105-degree bending angle ESA with an average radius of 100 mm and a plate spacing of 2.84 mm. Sixteen CEMs contiguously spaced along the exit gap of the ESA give about 5-degree polar angular resolution over the approximately 70-degree opening angle of the acceptance fan. The electron sensor consists of a 120-degree bending angle ESA with an average radius of 41.9 mm and a plate spacing of 3.5 mm. Seven large-funnel CEMs along the exit gap give about 20-degree angular resolution over a 160-degree fan angle. The sensor geometric factors are 0.002 cm2-sr for isotropic response and 0.009 cm2 for unidirectional. Energy resolution is five percent for ions and twelve percent for electrons. SWEPAM data consists of ion and electron rates collected at each energy/charge (E/Q) step, polar lock direction, and azimuthal spin direction. A single spacecraft spin period of 12 seconds is sufficient for accumulation of count matricies to fully calculate the electron and ion distribution functions from which bulk moments (solar wind speed, density, temperature) can be calculated by ground data processing. Accumulated counts will actually be summed over one-minute intervals for increased statistical accuracy and for reduction of telemetry requirements. Limited data from single spins will be provided for timing of the passage of transient solar wind structures.</Description>

            <Description>MAG includes both a flux gate magnetometer and a vector/scalar helium magnetometer. Because magnetometers are sensitive to electric currents and ferrous metal components, they are generally placed on an extended boom, as far from the spacecraft as possible. On Cassini, the flux gate magnetometer is located midway out on the 11-meter (36-foot) magnetometer boom extending out from the spacecraft, and the vector/scalar helium magnetometer is located at the end of the boom. The boom itself, composed of thin, nonmetallic rods, was folded during launch and deployed about two years after launch. The magnetometer electronics are located in a bay in the Cassini orbiter's spacecraft body.</Description>

 Scientific Objectives
  =====================
    The primary objectives of the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave
    investigation are to study radio emissions, plasma waves, thermal
    plasma, and dust in the vicinity of Saturn.

    Objectives concerning radio emissions include:

      Improve our knowledge of the rotational modulation of Saturn's
      radio sources, and hence of Saturn's rotation rate.

      Determine the location of the SKR source as a function of
      frequency, and investigate the mechanisms involved in generating
      the radiation.

      Obtain a quantitative evaluation of the anomalies in Saturn's
      magnetic field by performing direction-finding measurements of the
      SKR source.

      Establish if gaseous ejections from the moons Rhea, Dione, and
      Tethys are responsible for the low frequency narrow-band radio
      emissions.

      Determine if SKR is controlled by Dione's orbital position.

      Establish the nature of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction
      by using SKR as a remote indicator of magnetospheric processes.

      Investigate the relationship between SKR and the occurrence of
      spokes and other time dependent phenomena in the rings.

      Study the fine structure in the SKR spectrum, and compare with the
      fine structure of terrestrial and Jovian radio emissions in order
      to understand the origin of this fine structure.

    Objectives concerning plasma waves include:

      Establish the spectrum and types of plasma waves associated with
      gaseous emissions from Titan, the rings, and the icy satellites.

      Determine the role of plasma waves in the interaction of Saturn's
      magnetospheric plasma (and the solar wind) with the ionosphere of
      Titan.

      Establish the spectrum and types of plasma waves that exist in the
      radiation belt of Saturn.

      Determine the wave-particle interactions responsible for the loss
      of radiation belt particles.

      Establish the spectrum and types of waves that exist in the
      magnetotail and polar regions of Saturn's magnetosphere.

      Determine if waves driven by field-aligned currents along the
      auroral field lines play a significant role in the auroral charged
      particle acceleration.

      Determine the electron density in the magnetosphere of Saturn,
      near the icy moons, and in the ionosphere of Titan.

    Objectives concerning lightning include:

      Establish the long-term morphology and temporal variability of
      lightning in the atmosphere of Saturn.

      Determine the spatial and temporal variation of the electron
      density in Saturn's ionosphere from the low frequency cutoff and
      absorption of lightning signals.

      Carry out a definitive search for lightning in Titan's atmosphere
      during the numerous close flybys of Titan.

      Perform high-resolution studies of the waveform and spectrum of
      lightning in the atmosphere of Saturn, and compare with
      terrestrial lightning.

    Objectives concerning thermal plasma include:

      Determine the spatial and temporal distribution of the electron
      density and temperature in Titan's ionosphere.

      Characterize the escape of thermal plasma from Titan's ionosphere
      in the downstream wake region.

      Constrain and, when possible, measure the electron density and
      temperature in other regions of Saturn's magnetosphere.

    Objectives concerning dust include:

      Determine the spatial distribution of micron-sized dust particles
      through out the Saturnian system.

      Measure the mass distribution of the impacting particles from
      pulse height analyses of the impact waveforms.

      Determine the possible role of charged dust particles as a source
      of field-aligned currents.


  Calibration
  ===========
  
    An extensive series of amplitude calibrations, frequency responses,
    phase calibrations, and instrument performance checks were carried
    out on the RPWS prior to launch, both before and after integration
    on the spacecraft. These tests and calibrations were performed at
    room temperature (25 deg C), -20 deg C, and 40 deg C. While there are
    calibration signals available in the instrument for in-flight
    calibration purposes, these are mainly used to check for drifts due
    to aging or radiation exposure. The primary calibration information
    to derive physical units (spectral density, etc.) is derived from
    the prelaunch tests.


  Operational Considerations
  ==========================
  
    The different types of receivers used to cover the spectral and
    temporal range covered by the RPWS does not lend itself to a
    monolithic, synchronous mode of operation. Nevertheless, to reduce
    the magnitude of the in-flight operations to an acceptable level
    requires that many of the measurements be scheduled in a systematic
    way. The approach is to attempt to acquire survey information in the
    form of uniform spectral and temporal observations at a low enough
    data rate, ~1 kbps, to ensure that such coverage is available for
    the entire Saturnian tour and for a large portion of the cruise and
    approach to Saturn. The survey data set will support spatial
    mapping, statistical studies, and studies of dynamical effects in
    the magnetosphere and their possible correlation with solar wind
    variations. In addition to the survey information, special
    observations will be added (sometimes at greatly increased data
    rates) at specific locations or times to provide enhanced
    information required by several of the science objectives. The
    special observations may include full polarization and
    direction-finding capability or high spectral or temporal resolution
    observations by the high frequency receiver, wideband measurements
    at one of the possible bandwidths, acquisition of delta-ne/ne
    measurements, or intensive wave-normal analysis afforded by
    acquiring five-channel waveforms on an accelerated schedule. While
    minimizing the number of different modes in which the instrument is
    operated both simplifies operations and yields a more manageable
    data set, flexibility (for example in the duty cycle of wideband
    measurements) increases the likelihood that enhanced measurements
    can be integrated successfully with the resource requirements of the
    other instruments. One of the resources which will be most limited
    on Cassini is the overall data volume; RPWS requires large data
    volumes for some of its measurements.


  Detectors
  =========
  
    The RPWS utilizes three 10-m electric antennas, three magnetic
    antennas, and a Langmuir probe for detectors.  Three monopole
    electric field antennas, labeled Eu, Ev, and Ew, are used to provide
    electric field signals to the various receivers. The physical
    orientations of these three antennas relative to the x, y, and z
    axes of the spacecraft are given below. However, the electrical
    orientations of these are strongly affected by the asymmetric nature
    of the ground plane of the spacecraft chassis.  These electrical
    orientations are incorporated into the calibrations, primarily of
    the High Frequency Receiver.  By electronically taking the
    difference between the voltages on the Eu and Ev monopoles, these
    two antennas can be used as a dipole, Ex, aligned along the x axis
    of the spacecraft.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|    Physical orientations of the electric monopole antennas: |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Antenna  |  theta (degrees) | phi (degrees)              |
|        Eu   |     107.5        |   24.8                     |
|        Ev   |     107.5        |  155.2                     |
|        Ew   |      37.0        |   90.0                     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

    The angle theta is the polar angle measured from the spacecraft +z
    axis.  The angle phi is the azimuthal angle, measured from the
    spacecraft +x axis.

    The tri-axial search coil magnetic antennas, labeled Bx, By, and Bz,
    are used to detect three orthogonal magnetic components of
    electromagnetic waves. The search coil axes are aligned along the x,
    y, and z axes of the spacecraft.

    The spherical Langmuir probe is used for electron density and
    temperature measurements.  This is extended from the spacecraft in
    approximately the -x direction, in spacecraft coordinates.


  Electronics
  ===========
  
    The electronics consists of five receivers. These receivers are
    connected to the antennas described above by a network of switches.
    The high frequency receiver (HFR) provides simultaneous auto- and
    cross-correlation measurements from two selected antennas over a
    frequency range from 3.5 kHz and 16 MHz. By switching the two inputs
    of this receiver between the three monopole electric antennas, this
    receiver can provide direction-of-arrival measurements, plus a full
    determination of the four Stokes parameters. The high frequency
    receiver includes a processor that performs all of its digital
    signal processing, including data compression. The high frequency
    receiver also includes a sounder transmitter that can be used to
    transmit short square wave pulses from 3.6 to 115.2 kHz. When used
    in conjunction with the high frequency receiver, the sounder can
    stimulate resonances in the plasma, most notably at the electron
    plasma frequency, thereby providing a direct measurement of the
    electron number density.  The medium frequency receiver (MFR)
    provides intensity measurements from a single selected antenna over
    a frequency range from 24 Hz to 12 kHz. This receiver is usually
    operated in a mode that toggles every 32 seconds between the Ex
    electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic search coil, thereby
    providing spectral information for both the electric and magnetic
    components of plasma waves. The low frequency receiver (LFR)
    provides intensity measurements from 1 Hz to 26 Hz, typically from
    the Ex electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic antenna. The
    five-channel waveform receiver (WFR) collects simultaneous waveforms
    from up to five sensors for short intervals in one of two frequency
    bands, either 1 to 26 Hz, or 3 Hz to 2.5 kHz. When connected to two
    electric and three magnetic antennas, this receiver provides wave
    normal measurements of electromagnetic plasma waves. The wideband
    receiver is designed to provide nearly continuous wideband waveform
    measurements over a bandwidth of either 60 Hz to 10.5 kHz, or 800 Hz
    to 75 kHz. These waveforms can be analyzed on the ground in either
    the temporal domain, or in the frequency domain (Fourier
    transformed) to provide high-resolution frequency-time spectrograms.
    In a special frequency-conversion mode of operation, the high
    frequency receiver can provide waveforms to the wideband receiver in
    a 25-kHz bandwidth that is tunable to any frequency between 125 kHz
    and 16 MHz.

    The Langmuir probe controller is used to sweep the bias voltage of
    the probe over a range from -32 to +32 V in order to obtain the
    current-voltage characteristics of the probe, and thereby the
    electron density and temperature. The controller can also set the
    bias voltage on the Eu and Ev monopoles over a range from -10 to +10
    V in order to operate them in a current collection mode for
    delta-ne/ne measurements.

    The RPWS data processing unit consists of three processors. The
    first processor, called the low-rate processor, controls all
    instrument functions, collects data from the high frequency
    receiver, the medium frequency receiver, the low frequency receiver,
    and the Langmuir probe, and carries out all communications with the
    spacecraft Command and Data System (CDS). The second processor,
    called the highrate processor, handles data from the wideband and
    five-channel waveform receivers and passes the data along to the
    low-rate processor for transmission to the CDS. The third processor,
    called the data compression processor, is primarily used for data
    compression, but can also perform specialized operations such as
    on-board dust detection by using waveforms from the wideband
    receiver.&quot;

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02--40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440--29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1--700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1--100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1--100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10--200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>This instrument (FGM: Fluxgate Magnetometer) consists of two tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers mounted on one of the two 5 m radial booms, plus a data processing unit (DPU) on the main equipment platform. The magnetometer boom lies in the spacecraft spin plane, with the outboard sensor at the boom tip and the inboard sensor mounted 1.5 m inboard from the tip, to minimize the importance of the spacecraft background magnetic field and its variations. The sensors are mounted such that the X axes are aligned with the spacecraft spin axis, and the other axes are in the spin plane. There are five sensitivity ranges, from +/- 256 nT to +/- 65,500 nT (used only to facilitate ground testing). Range switching can be automatic or by command. Calibration is done by introducing a known current step into the feedback loop of the sensors. Telemetry allocation limits the normal output to about 20 vectors/s. For short periods at higher time resolution, data are stored at rates of up to 124.3 vectors/s in a memory block, the micro-structure analyzer (MSA). The MSA capacity is 32,000 vectors, more than 4 minutes of data at the highest sampling rate. This memory is continually over-written until a special event is detected, when its contents are frozen and held for readout interleaved with the normal lower-resolution data. The DPU has dual redundancy, including two CPUs. The CPU convolves the full bandwidth data with a Gaussian digital filter to match the rate and bandwidth of the transmitted vectors to the available telemetry rate. Unfiltered vector data are sent at 64.35 ms intervals to all but one of the other experiments. The DPU has a number of stored algorithms for recognition of events of particular interest, to trigger the MSA. The objective is to identify such events as boundary crossings or shocks when the high-rate capability of the MSA for short periods could capture the detailed signature of the event. The algorithms were defined at an early stage, but resettable thresholds for the event triggers will enable optimization in flight. There are eight different telemetry operating modes of the instrument, corresponding to both normal and burst modes, with MSA readout rates of 0, 9, 12, or 120 vectors/s.

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment) is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy, polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix. Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the energies from 0.7--10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0--180 degrees with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin, all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late, but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again, but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

D. Johnstone et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The dual-sensor spectrometer RAPID (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors) analyzes suprathermal plasma distributions in the energy range from 20--400 KeV for electrons and from 2 KeV/nucleon to 1.50 MeV/nucleon for ions. Angular distributions are measured over a range of 180 degrees in polar angle for either species. Electrons are identified by the well-known energy-range relationship. The detection principle for ions is based on a two-dimensional analysis of a particle's velocity and energy. Moderate mass resolution of about four (for oxygen ions) permits the identification of ions and ion groups of significance. Particle species identified are electrons, protons, He and CNO group ions, and energetic neutral atoms of energies 10--100 KeV. RAPID science data are transmitted through a complex data format, using 17 Kbps in the telemetry nominal mode. Time resolution is as high as 16 samples/spin for certain elements. The nominal spin period for the spacecraft is 4 s. The RAPID field of view covers a range of 180 degrees with respect to the spin vector. The sensor systems, IIMS and IES, scan the full range of the solid angle as the spacecraft rotates. The data returned will be used to project the intensity distribution in distant particle sources on a spherical or plane image area with 192 pixels for IIMS and 144 pixels for IES. The Imaging Ion Mass Spectrometer (IIMS) sensor system is composed of three identical SCENIC (Spectroscopic Camera for Electrons, Neutral and Ion Composition) heads. The sensor systems of IIMS are identical to those in the HEP-LD instrument included in the Japanese Geotail spacecraft. The IIMS uses two-dimensional time-of-flight/energy analysis to determine particle mass. The addition of position-sensing techniques on the entrance foil, in combination with a geometrically small stop detector at the end of the flight path provides directional sensitivity. This approach divides the 180 degree polar segment into twelve contiguous angular intervals. Sectoring the spacecraft spin plane with a maximum of sixteen azimuthal intervals covers the unit sphere in velocity space completely with a total of 192 angular bins. The Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) achieves directional sensitivity by using novel microstrip solid-state devices in combination with a pin-hole acceptance. This technique divides the 180 degree polar range into nine angular intervals which, with sixteen sectors in the spin plane, corresponds to a total of 144 bins on the unit sphere. The RAPID spectrometer is connected to the magnetic field instrument FGM through the inter-experiment link. FGM sends 64 uncorrected magnetic field vectors per spacecraft rotation. These are used by the data processor to determine, for each of the sixteen azimuthal sectors, which look directions in the IIMS and IES fans are perpendicular to the current magnetic field vector.

            <Description>This experiment (STAFF: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations) is one of the five complementary experiments which form the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. STAFF consists of: (1) a triaxial boom-mounted search-coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic components of electromagnetic fluctuations (up to 4 KHz); and, (2) a spectrum analyzer to compute the 25 auto- and cross-correlation coefficients of the spectral matrix, using three magnetic and two electric components of the waves. The magnetic waveform (up to either 10 Hz or 180 Hz) is also transmitted. The Z-axis sensor is parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Each sensor consists of a high-permeability core embedded inside two solenoids. The frequency response of the main winding is flattened by a secondary winding through a flux feedback effect, in the range 40--4000 Hz. Further, the secondary winding is used as a calibration loop to which an external AC signal is applied. In normal bit rate the wave-form data cover the 0.1--10 Hz frequency range, and the spectrum analyzer covers the range 8 Hz to 4 KHz. In high bit rate, the wave-form data cover 0.1--180 Hz and the spectrum analyzer covers 64 Hz to 4 KHz, using only the two highest frequency bands. In the base mode in normal bit rate the auto-spectra are averaged over 1 s, and the complete 25-component matrix is averaged over 4 s for five components. In high bit rate, only the two highest frequency bands are analyzed. In the fast modes, time resolution is 1 s for the cross-spectra, and either 0.125 s or 0.25 s for the auto-spectra. Other modes are also defined. The analysis will also use electric field waveform data from the EFW (part of WEC), and the hardware of the two instruments was designed to optimize correlation: low-pass filters are identical, sampling frequency is the same, and there is a synchronization signal for simultaneous sampling. The output signals of the STAFF magnetic preamplifiers are also sent to two other instruments: the WBD (part of WEC) and the EDI. Some of the magnetospheric structures to be studied are of small scale, and where the signature duration is of the order 1 s or less, the STAFF search coil data are complementary to those of the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM).

            <Description>This instrument (WHISPER: Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of the Electron density by Relaxation) is part of the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. Its objectives are to: (1) measure the electron density via active sounding of plasma resonances; and, (2) record via passive wave analysis the natural wave emissions in the high-frequency range, from 4--80 KHz. An active sounder can provide the total local electron density, including the cold component, which is the dominant one in many of the regions to be explored. Most of the time, this cold component cannot be obtained from particle experiments, owing to the satellite's electric potential and photoelectron sheath disturbance. The sounder consists of three main parts: (1) a sensitive double-sphere antenna, measuring the AC electric field, provided as part of the EFW experiment; (2) a transmitter, a receiver, a digital spectrum analyzer, and a controller unit, which form the WHISPER instrument itself; and, (3) command and data processing systems, which are part of the DWP experiment, which also takes care of command and telemetry for the entire WEC unit. During the active part of WHISPER operation, in each frequency step a short (1 ms in normal mode; 0.5 ms also possible) wave train at the fixed frequency is transmitted. The receiver is then activated to receive until the end of the frequency step. This is repeated for a series of frequencies, sweeping a designated range of frequencies. The frequency step duration is a multiple of 13.33 ms to allow good synchronization with the EFW instrument's sampling period, and ranges up to ~250 ms. The sweep duration is a number of steps, and ranges from 0.5 s to ~10 s. The total frequency range available for the active transmitter is from 4--80 KHz. Different signal strength levels can be selected, e.g. 50, 100, 200 V peak to peak. During passive operations, there is no short pulse transmitted. The receiver signal is measured each 13.33 ms, and after A/D conversion it is analyzed in frequency by the vector signal processor (VSP), which performs a fast Fourier transform and delivers 64 to 512 useful bins in the range 0--80 KHz. The 512-bin option is always used in sounding mode. The operational details of the instrument are managed by the microcontroller, which also handles the interface to the DWP. Extensive data compression is used, either in the DWP (normal) or within WHISPER itself as backup. There is a considerable number of WHISPER modes, with a corresponding range of frequency resolutions and final data rates. In the standard WEC modes, the telemetry rate is about 980 bps in routine and 5800 bps in high rate. Plasma densities from 0.2 to 80 cm**-3 are measured, with a time resolution of 4 s routine and 1 s at best. Natural wave electric fields are measured with a sensitivity of 0.05 microV/(m sqrt(Hz)). Time and frequency resolutions are 3 s and 640 Hz routine, and 100 ms and 320 Hz at best. In any given mode, the dynamic range is about 100 dB, but 124 dB absolute range can be reached by commanded gain change.

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02--40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440--29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1--700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1--100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1--100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10--200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>This instrument (FGM: Fluxgate Magnetometer) consists of two tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers mounted on one of the two 5 m radial booms, plus a data processing unit (DPU) on the main equipment platform. The magnetometer boom lies in the spacecraft spin plane, with the outboard sensor at the boom tip and the inboard sensor mounted 1.5 m inboard from the tip, to minimize the importance of the spacecraft background magnetic field and its variations. The sensors are mounted such that the X axes are aligned with the spacecraft spin axis, and the other axes are in the spin plane. There are five sensitivity ranges, from +/- 256 nT to +/- 65,500 nT (used only to facilitate ground testing). Range switching can be automatic or by command. Calibration is done by introducing a known current step into the feedback loop of the sensors. Telemetry allocation limits the normal output to about 20 vectors/s. For short periods at higher time resolution, data are stored at rates of up to 124.3 vectors/s in a memory block, the micro-structure analyzer (MSA). The MSA capacity is 32,000 vectors, more than 4 minutes of data at the highest sampling rate. This memory is continually over-written until a special event is detected, when its contents are frozen and held for readout interleaved with the normal lower-resolution data. The DPU has dual redundancy, including two CPUs. The CPU convolves the full bandwidth data with a Gaussian digital filter to match the rate and bandwidth of the transmitted vectors to the available telemetry rate. Unfiltered vector data are sent at 64.35 ms intervals to all but one of the other experiments. The DPU has a number of stored algorithms for recognition of events of particular interest, to trigger the MSA. The objective is to identify such events as boundary crossings or shocks when the high-rate capability of the MSA for short periods could capture the detailed signature of the event. The algorithms were defined at an early stage, but resettable thresholds for the event triggers will enable optimization in flight. There are eight different telemetry operating modes of the instrument, corresponding to both normal and burst modes, with MSA readout rates of 0, 9, 12, or 120 vectors/s.

Balogh et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment) is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy, polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix. Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the energies from 0.7--10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0--180 degrees with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin, all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late, but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again, but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The dual-sensor spectrometer RAPID (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors) analyzes suprathermal plasma distributions in the energy range from 20--400 KeV for electrons and from 2 KeV/nucleon to 1.50 MeV/nucleon for ions. Angular distributions are measured over a range of 180 degrees in polar angle for either species. Electrons are identified by the well-known energy-range relationship. The detection principle for ions is based on a two-dimensional analysis of a particle's velocity and energy. Moderate mass resolution of about four (for oxygen ions) permits the identification of ions and ion groups of significance. Particle species identified are electrons, protons, He and CNO group ions, and energetic neutral atoms of energies 10--100 KeV. RAPID science data are transmitted through a complex data format, using 17 Kbps in the telemetry nominal mode. Time resolution is as high as 16 samples/spin for certain elements. The nominal spin period for the spacecraft is 4 s. The RAPID field of view covers a range of 180 degrees with respect to the spin vector. The sensor systems, IIMS and IES, scan the full range of the solid angle as the spacecraft rotates. The data returned will be used to project the intensity distribution in distant particle sources on a spherical or plane image area with 192 pixels for IIMS and 144 pixels for IES. The Imaging Ion Mass Spectrometer (IIMS) sensor system is composed of three identical SCENIC (Spectroscopic Camera for Electrons, Neutral and Ion Composition) heads. The sensor systems of IIMS are identical to those in the HEP-LD instrument included in the Japanese Geotail spacecraft. The IIMS uses two-dimensional time-of-flight/energy analysis to determine particle mass. The addition of position-sensing techniques on the entrance foil, in combination with a geometrically small stop detector at the end of the flight path provides directional sensitivity. This approach divides the 180 degree polar segment into twelve contiguous angular intervals. Sectoring the spacecraft spin plane with a maximum of sixteen azimuthal intervals covers the unit sphere in velocity space completely with a total of 192 angular bins. The Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) achieves directional sensitivity by using novel microstrip solid-state devices in combination with a pin-hole acceptance. This technique divides the 180 degree polar range into nine angular intervals which, with sixteen sectors in the spin plane, corresponds to a total of 144 bins on the unit sphere. The RAPID spectrometer is connected to the magnetic field instrument FGM through the inter-experiment link. FGM sends 64 uncorrected magnetic field vectors per spacecraft rotation. These are used by the data processor to determine, for each of the sixteen azimuthal sectors, which look directions in the IIMS and IES fans are perpendicular to the current magnetic field vector.

            <Description>This experiment (STAFF: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations) is one of the five complementary experiments which form the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. STAFF consists of: (1) a triaxial boom-mounted search-coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic components of electromagnetic fluctuations (up to 4 KHz); and, (2) a spectrum analyzer to compute the 25 auto- and cross-correlation coefficients of the spectral matrix, using three magnetic and two electric components of the waves. The magnetic waveform (up to either 10 Hz or 180 Hz) is also transmitted. The Z-axis sensor is parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Each sensor consists of a high-permeability core embedded inside two solenoids. The frequency response of the main winding is flattened by a secondary winding through a flux feedback effect, in the range 40--4000 Hz. Further, the secondary winding is used as a calibration loop to which an external AC signal is applied. In normal bit rate the wave-form data cover the 0.1--10 Hz frequency range, and the spectrum analyzer covers the range 8 Hz to 4 KHz. In high bit rate, the wave-form data cover 0.1--180 Hz and the spectrum analyzer covers 64 Hz to 4 KHz, using only the two highest frequency bands. In the base mode in normal bit rate the auto-spectra are averaged over 1 s, and the complete 25-component matrix is averaged over 4 s for five components. In high bit rate, only the two highest frequency bands are analyzed. In the fast modes, time resolution is 1 s for the cross-spectra, and either 0.125 s or 0.25 s for the auto-spectra. Other modes are also defined. The analysis will also use electric field waveform data from the EFW (part of WEC), and the hardware of the two instruments was designed to optimize correlation: low-pass filters are identical, sampling frequency is the same, and there is a synchronization signal for simultaneous sampling. The output signals of the STAFF magnetic preamplifiers are also sent to two other instruments: the WBD (part of WEC) and the EDI. Some of the magnetospheric structures to be studied are of small scale, and where the signature duration is of the order 1 s or less, the STAFF search coil data are complementary to those of the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM).

            <Description>This instrument (WHISPER: Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of the Electron density by Relaxation) is part of the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. Its objectives are to: (1) measure the electron density via active sounding of plasma resonances; and, (2) record via passive wave analysis the natural wave emissions in the high-frequency range, from 4--80 KHz. An active sounder can provide the total local electron density, including the cold component, which is the dominant one in many of the regions to be explored. Most of the time, this cold component cannot be obtained from particle experiments, owing to the satellite's electric potential and photoelectron sheath disturbance. The sounder consists of three main parts: (1) a sensitive double-sphere antenna, measuring the AC electric field, provided as part of the EFW experiment; (2) a transmitter, a receiver, a digital spectrum analyzer, and a controller unit, which form the WHISPER instrument itself; and, (3) command and data processing systems, which are part of the DWP experiment, which also takes care of command and telemetry for the entire WEC unit. During the active part of WHISPER operation, in each frequency step a short (1 ms in normal mode; 0.5 ms also possible) wave train at the fixed frequency is transmitted. The receiver is then activated to receive until the end of the frequency step. This is repeated for a series of frequencies, sweeping a designated range of frequencies. The frequency step duration is a multiple of 13.33 ms to allow good synchronization with the EFW instrument's sampling period, and ranges up to ~250 ms. The sweep duration is a number of steps, and ranges from 0.5 s to ~10 s. The total frequency range available for the active transmitter is from 4--80 KHz. Different signal strength levels can be selected, e.g. 50, 100, 200 V peak to peak. During passive operations, there is no short pulse transmitted. The receiver signal is measured each 13.33 ms, and after A/D conversion it is analyzed in frequency by the vector signal processor (VSP), which performs a fast Fourier transform and delivers 64 to 512 useful bins in the range 0--80 KHz. The 512-bin option is always used in sounding mode. The operational details of the instrument are managed by the microcontroller, which also handles the interface to the DWP. Extensive data compression is used, either in the DWP (normal) or within WHISPER itself as backup. There is a considerable number of WHISPER modes, with a corresponding range of frequency resolutions and final data rates. In the standard WEC modes, the telemetry rate is about 980 bps in routine and 5800 bps in high rate. Plasma densities from 0.2 to 80 cm**-3 are measured, with a time resolution of 4 s routine and 1 s at best. Natural wave electric fields are measured with a sensitivity of 0.05 microV/(m sqrt(Hz)). Time and frequency resolutions are 3 s and 640 Hz routine, and 100 ms and 320 Hz at best. In any given mode, the dynamic range is about 100 dB, but 124 dB absolute range can be reached by commanded gain change.

CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02--40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440--29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1--700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1--100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1--100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10--200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>This instrument (FGM: Fluxgate Magnetometer) consists of two tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers mounted on one of the two 5 m radial booms, plus a data processing unit (DPU) on the main equipment platform. The magnetometer boom lies in the spacecraft spin plane, with the outboard sensor at the boom tip and the inboard sensor mounted 1.5 m inboard from the tip, to minimize the importance of the spacecraft background magnetic field and its variations. The sensors are mounted such that the X axes are aligned with the spacecraft spin axis, and the other axes are in the spin plane. There are five sensitivity ranges, from +/- 256 nT to +/- 65,500 nT (used only to facilitate ground testing). Range switching can be automatic or by command. Calibration is done by introducing a known current step into the feedback loop of the sensors. Telemetry allocation limits the normal output to about 20 vectors/s. For short periods at higher time resolution, data are stored at rates of up to 124.3 vectors/s in a memory block, the micro-structure analyzer (MSA). The MSA capacity is 32,000 vectors, more than 4 minutes of data at the highest sampling rate. This memory is continually over-written until a special event is detected, when its contents are frozen and held for readout interleaved with the normal lower-resolution data. The DPU has dual redundancy, including two CPUs. The CPU convolves the full bandwidth data with a Gaussian digital filter to match the rate and bandwidth of the transmitted vectors to the available telemetry rate. Unfiltered vector data are sent at 64.35 ms intervals to all but one of the other experiments. The DPU has a number of stored algorithms for recognition of events of particular interest, to trigger the MSA. The objective is to identify such events as boundary crossings or shocks when the high-rate capability of the MSA for short periods could capture the detailed signature of the event. The algorithms were defined at an early stage, but resettable thresholds for the event triggers will enable optimization in flight. There are eight different telemetry operating modes of the instrument, corresponding to both normal and burst modes, with MSA readout rates of 0, 9, 12, or 120 vectors/s.

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment) is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy, polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix. Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the energies from 0.7--10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0--180 degrees with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin, all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late, but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again, but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The dual-sensor spectrometer RAPID (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors) analyzes suprathermal plasma distributions in the energy range from 20--400 KeV for electrons and from 2 KeV/nucleon to 1.50 MeV/nucleon for ions. Angular distributions are measured over a range of 180 degrees in polar angle for either species. Electrons are identified by the well-known energy-range relationship. The detection principle for ions is based on a two-dimensional analysis of a particle's velocity and energy. Moderate mass resolution of about four (for oxygen ions) permits the identification of ions and ion groups of significance. Particle species identified are electrons, protons, He and CNO group ions, and energetic neutral atoms of energies 10--100 KeV. RAPID science data are transmitted through a complex data format, using 17 Kbps in the telemetry nominal mode. Time resolution is as high as 16 samples/spin for certain elements. The nominal spin period for the spacecraft is 4 s. The RAPID field of view covers a range of 180 degrees with respect to the spin vector. The sensor systems, IIMS and IES, scan the full range of the solid angle as the spacecraft rotates. The data returned will be used to project the intensity distribution in distant particle sources on a spherical or plane image area with 192 pixels for IIMS and 144 pixels for IES. The Imaging Ion Mass Spectrometer (IIMS) sensor system is composed of three identical SCENIC (Spectroscopic Camera for Electrons, Neutral and Ion Composition) heads. The sensor systems of IIMS are identical to those in the HEP-LD instrument included in the Japanese Geotail spacecraft. The IIMS uses two-dimensional time-of-flight/energy analysis to determine particle mass. The addition of position-sensing techniques on the entrance foil, in combination with a geometrically small stop detector at the end of the flight path provides directional sensitivity. This approach divides the 180 degree polar segment into twelve contiguous angular intervals. Sectoring the spacecraft spin plane with a maximum of sixteen azimuthal intervals covers the unit sphere in velocity space completely with a total of 192 angular bins. The Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) achieves directional sensitivity by using novel microstrip solid-state devices in combination with a pin-hole acceptance. This technique divides the 180 degree polar range into nine angular intervals which, with sixteen sectors in the spin plane, corresponds to a total of 144 bins on the unit sphere. The RAPID spectrometer is connected to the magnetic field instrument FGM through the inter-experiment link. FGM sends 64 uncorrected magnetic field vectors per spacecraft rotation. These are used by the data processor to determine, for each of the sixteen azimuthal sectors, which look directions in the IIMS and IES fans are perpendicular to the current magnetic field vector.

            <Description>This experiment (STAFF: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations) is one of the five complementary experiments which form the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. STAFF consists of: (1) a triaxial boom-mounted search-coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic components of electromagnetic fluctuations (up to 4 KHz); and, (2) a spectrum analyzer to compute the 25 auto- and cross-correlation coefficients of the spectral matrix, using three magnetic and two electric components of the waves. The magnetic waveform (up to either 10 Hz or 180 Hz) is also transmitted. The Z-axis sensor is parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Each sensor consists of a high-permeability core embedded inside two solenoids. The frequency response of the main winding is flattened by a secondary winding through a flux feedback effect, in the range 40--4000 Hz. Further, the secondary winding is used as a calibration loop to which an external AC signal is applied. In normal bit rate the wave-form data cover the 0.1--10 Hz frequency range, and the spectrum analyzer covers the range 8 Hz to 4 KHz. In high bit rate, the wave-form data cover 0.1--180 Hz and the spectrum analyzer covers 64 Hz to 4 KHz, using only the two highest frequency bands. In the base mode in normal bit rate the auto-spectra are averaged over 1 s, and the complete 25-component matrix is averaged over 4 s for five components. In high bit rate, only the two highest frequency bands are analyzed. In the fast modes, time resolution is 1 s for the cross-spectra, and either 0.125 s or 0.25 s for the auto-spectra. Other modes are also defined. The analysis will also use electric field waveform data from the EFW (part of WEC), and the hardware of the two instruments was designed to optimize correlation: low-pass filters are identical, sampling frequency is the same, and there is a synchronization signal for simultaneous sampling. The output signals of the STAFF magnetic preamplifiers are also sent to two other instruments: the WBD (part of WEC) and the EDI. Some of the magnetospheric structures to be studied are of small scale, and where the signature duration is of the order 1 s or less, the STAFF search coil data are complementary to those of the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM).

            <Description>This instrument (WHISPER: Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of the Electron density by Relaxation) is part of the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. Its objectives are to: (1) measure the electron density via active sounding of plasma resonances; and, (2) record via passive wave analysis the natural wave emissions in the high-frequency range, from 4--80 KHz. An active sounder can provide the total local electron density, including the cold component, which is the dominant one in many of the regions to be explored. Most of the time, this cold component cannot be obtained from particle experiments, owing to the satellite's electric potential and photoelectron sheath disturbance. The sounder consists of three main parts: (1) a sensitive double-sphere antenna, measuring the AC electric field, provided as part of the EFW experiment; (2) a transmitter, a receiver, a digital spectrum analyzer, and a controller unit, which form the WHISPER instrument itself; and, (3) command and data processing systems, which are part of the DWP experiment, which also takes care of command and telemetry for the entire WEC unit. During the active part of WHISPER operation, in each frequency step a short (1 ms in normal mode; 0.5 ms also possible) wave train at the fixed frequency is transmitted. The receiver is then activated to receive until the end of the frequency step. This is repeated for a series of frequencies, sweeping a designated range of frequencies. The frequency step duration is a multiple of 13.33 ms to allow good synchronization with the EFW instrument's sampling period, and ranges up to ~250 ms. The sweep duration is a number of steps, and ranges from 0.5 s to ~10 s. The total frequency range available for the active transmitter is from 4--80 KHz. Different signal strength levels can be selected, e.g. 50, 100, 200 V peak to peak. During passive operations, there is no short pulse transmitted. The receiver signal is measured each 13.33 ms, and after A/D conversion it is analyzed in frequency by the vector signal processor (VSP), which performs a fast Fourier transform and delivers 64 to 512 useful bins in the range 0--80 KHz. The 512-bin option is always used in sounding mode. The operational details of the instrument are managed by the microcontroller, which also handles the interface to the DWP. Extensive data compression is used, either in the DWP (normal) or within WHISPER itself as backup. There is a considerable number of WHISPER modes, with a corresponding range of frequency resolutions and final data rates. In the standard WEC modes, the telemetry rate is about 980 bps in routine and 5800 bps in high rate. Plasma densities from 0.2 to 80 cm**-3 are measured, with a time resolution of 4 s routine and 1 s at best. Natural wave electric fields are measured with a sensitivity of 0.05 microV/(m sqrt(Hz)). Time and frequency resolutions are 3 s and 640 Hz routine, and 100 ms and 320 Hz at best. In any given mode, the dynamic range is about 100 dB, but 124 dB absolute range can be reached by commanded gain change.

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02--40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440--29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1--700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1--100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1--100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10--200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>This instrument (FGM: Fluxgate Magnetometer) consists of two tri-axial fluxgate magnetometers mounted on one of the two 5 m radial booms, plus a data processing unit (DPU) on the main equipment platform. The magnetometer boom lies in the spacecraft spin plane, with the outboard sensor at the boom tip and the inboard sensor mounted 1.5 m inboard from the tip, to minimize the importance of the spacecraft background magnetic field and its variations. The sensors are mounted such that the X axes are aligned with the spacecraft spin axis, and the other axes are in the spin plane. There are five sensitivity ranges, from +/- 256 nT to +/- 65,500 nT (used only to facilitate ground testing). Range switching can be automatic or by command. Calibration is done by introducing a known current step into the feedback loop of the sensors. Telemetry allocation limits the normal output to about 20 vectors/s. For short periods at higher time resolution, data are stored at rates of up to 124.3 vectors/s in a memory block, the micro-structure analyzer (MSA). The MSA capacity is 32,000 vectors, more than 4 minutes of data at the highest sampling rate. This memory is continually over-written until a special event is detected, when its contents are frozen and held for readout interleaved with the normal lower-resolution data. The DPU has dual redundancy, including two CPUs. The CPU convolves the full bandwidth data with a Gaussian digital filter to match the rate and bandwidth of the transmitted vectors to the available telemetry rate. Unfiltered vector data are sent at 64.35 ms intervals to all but one of the other experiments. The DPU has a number of stored algorithms for recognition of events of particular interest, to trigger the MSA. The objective is to identify such events as boundary crossings or shocks when the high-rate capability of the MSA for short periods could capture the detailed signature of the event. The algorithms were defined at an early stage, but resettable thresholds for the event triggers will enable optimization in flight. There are eight different telemetry operating modes of the instrument, corresponding to both normal and burst modes, with MSA readout rates of 0, 9, 12, or 120 vectors/s.

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment) is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy, polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix. Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the energies from 0.7--10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0--180 degrees with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin, all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late, but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again, but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The dual-sensor spectrometer RAPID (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging Detectors) analyzes suprathermal plasma distributions in the energy range from 20--400 KeV for electrons and from 2 KeV/nucleon to 1.50 MeV/nucleon for ions. Angular distributions are measured over a range of 180 degrees in polar angle for either species. Electrons are identified by the well-known energy-range relationship. The detection principle for ions is based on a two-dimensional analysis of a particle's velocity and energy. Moderate mass resolution of about four (for oxygen ions) permits the identification of ions and ion groups of significance. Particle species identified are electrons, protons, He and CNO group ions, and energetic neutral atoms of energies 10--100 KeV. RAPID science data are transmitted through a complex data format, using 17 Kbps in the telemetry nominal mode. Time resolution is as high as 16 samples/spin for certain elements. The nominal spin period for the spacecraft is 4 s. The RAPID field of view covers a range of 180 degrees with respect to the spin vector. The sensor systems, IIMS and IES, scan the full range of the solid angle as the spacecraft rotates. The data returned will be used to project the intensity distribution in distant particle sources on a spherical or plane image area with 192 pixels for IIMS and 144 pixels for IES. The Imaging Ion Mass Spectrometer (IIMS) sensor system is composed of three identical SCENIC (Spectroscopic Camera for Electrons, Neutral and Ion Composition) heads. The sensor systems of IIMS are identical to those in the HEP-LD instrument included in the Japanese Geotail spacecraft. The IIMS uses two-dimensional time-of-flight/energy analysis to determine particle mass. The addition of position-sensing techniques on the entrance foil, in combination with a geometrically small stop detector at the end of the flight path provides directional sensitivity. This approach divides the 180 degree polar segment into twelve contiguous angular intervals. Sectoring the spacecraft spin plane with a maximum of sixteen azimuthal intervals covers the unit sphere in velocity space completely with a total of 192 angular bins. The Imaging Electron Spectrometer (IES) achieves directional sensitivity by using novel microstrip solid-state devices in combination with a pin-hole acceptance. This technique divides the 180 degree polar range into nine angular intervals which, with sixteen sectors in the spin plane, corresponds to a total of 144 bins on the unit sphere. The RAPID spectrometer is connected to the magnetic field instrument FGM through the inter-experiment link. FGM sends 64 uncorrected magnetic field vectors per spacecraft rotation. These are used by the data processor to determine, for each of the sixteen azimuthal sectors, which look directions in the IIMS and IES fans are perpendicular to the current magnetic field vector.

            <Description>This experiment (STAFF: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field Fluctuations) is one of the five complementary experiments which form the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. STAFF consists of: (1) a triaxial boom-mounted search-coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic components of electromagnetic fluctuations (up to 4 KHz); and, (2) a spectrum analyzer to compute the 25 auto- and cross-correlation coefficients of the spectral matrix, using three magnetic and two electric components of the waves. The magnetic waveform (up to either 10 Hz or 180 Hz) is also transmitted. The Z-axis sensor is parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. Each sensor consists of a high-permeability core embedded inside two solenoids. The frequency response of the main winding is flattened by a secondary winding through a flux feedback effect, in the range 40--4000 Hz. Further, the secondary winding is used as a calibration loop to which an external AC signal is applied. In normal bit rate the wave-form data cover the 0.1--10 Hz frequency range, and the spectrum analyzer covers the range 8 Hz to 4 KHz. In high bit rate, the wave-form data cover 0.1--180 Hz and the spectrum analyzer covers 64 Hz to 4 KHz, using only the two highest frequency bands. In the base mode in normal bit rate the auto-spectra are averaged over 1 s, and the complete 25-component matrix is averaged over 4 s for five components. In high bit rate, only the two highest frequency bands are analyzed. In the fast modes, time resolution is 1 s for the cross-spectra, and either 0.125 s or 0.25 s for the auto-spectra. Other modes are also defined. The analysis will also use electric field waveform data from the EFW (part of WEC), and the hardware of the two instruments was designed to optimize correlation: low-pass filters are identical, sampling frequency is the same, and there is a synchronization signal for simultaneous sampling. The output signals of the STAFF magnetic preamplifiers are also sent to two other instruments: the WBD (part of WEC) and the EDI. Some of the magnetospheric structures to be studied are of small scale, and where the signature duration is of the order 1 s or less, the STAFF search coil data are complementary to those of the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM).

            <Description>This instrument (WHISPER: Waves of HIgh frequency and Sounder for Probing of the Electron density by Relaxation) is part of the Wave Experiment Consortium (WEC) on Cluster. Its objectives are to: (1) measure the electron density via active sounding of plasma resonances; and, (2) record via passive wave analysis the natural wave emissions in the high-frequency range, from 4--80 KHz. An active sounder can provide the total local electron density, including the cold component, which is the dominant one in many of the regions to be explored. Most of the time, this cold component cannot be obtained from particle experiments, owing to the satellite's electric potential and photoelectron sheath disturbance. The sounder consists of three main parts: (1) a sensitive double-sphere antenna, measuring the AC electric field, provided as part of the EFW experiment; (2) a transmitter, a receiver, a digital spectrum analyzer, and a controller unit, which form the WHISPER instrument itself; and, (3) command and data processing systems, which are part of the DWP experiment, which also takes care of command and telemetry for the entire WEC unit. During the active part of WHISPER operation, in each frequency step a short (1 ms in normal mode; 0.5 ms also possible) wave train at the fixed frequency is transmitted. The receiver is then activated to receive until the end of the frequency step. This is repeated for a series of frequencies, sweeping a designated range of frequencies. The frequency step duration is a multiple of 13.33 ms to allow good synchronization with the EFW instrument's sampling period, and ranges up to ~250 ms. The sweep duration is a number of steps, and ranges from 0.5 s to ~10 s. The total frequency range available for the active transmitter is from 4--80 KHz. Different signal strength levels can be selected, e.g. 50, 100, 200 V peak to peak. During passive operations, there is no short pulse transmitted. The receiver signal is measured each 13.33 ms, and after A/D conversion it is analyzed in frequency by the vector signal processor (VSP), which performs a fast Fourier transform and delivers 64 to 512 useful bins in the range 0--80 KHz. The 512-bin option is always used in sounding mode. The operational details of the instrument are managed by the microcontroller, which also handles the interface to the DWP. Extensive data compression is used, either in the DWP (normal) or within WHISPER itself as backup. There is a considerable number of WHISPER modes, with a corresponding range of frequency resolutions and final data rates. In the standard WEC modes, the telemetry rate is about 980 bps in routine and 5800 bps in high rate. Plasma densities from 0.2 to 80 cm**-3 are measured, with a time resolution of 4 s routine and 1 s at best. Natural wave electric fields are measured with a sensitivity of 0.05 microV/(m sqrt(Hz)). Time and frequency resolutions are 3 s and 640 Hz routine, and 100 ms and 320 Hz at best. In any given mode, the dynamic range is about 100 dB, but 124 dB absolute range can be reached by commanded gain change. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report ``Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities,'' March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article ``WHISPER, a Sounder and High-Frequency Wave Analyser Experiment,'' by P.

            <Description>
                The EPD was developed by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) in collaboration
                with the Max Planck Institute of Areronomy (MPAe), Germany, as part of NASA's Galileo Program.
                The EPD was successfully launched on the Galileo spacecraft in October 1989 from the Space Shuttle, and soon 
                thereafter achieved its Initial Delta VEGA trajectory towards Jupiter. On the way to Jupiter, Galileo flew 
                by Venus on 9 February 1990, and by Earth on 8 December 1990. It returned to Earth for a final flyby on
                8 December 1992 and was placed on trajectory to Jupiter. It arrived at that  giant planet on 7 December 1995.
                
                The EPD measures the detailed energy and angular distribution of the following:
                
                ÃÂ· ions (Z &gt;= 1) from 0.020 to 55 MeV, 
                ÃÂ· electrons from 0.015 MeV to more than 11 MeV, 
                ÃÂ· ion composition from 0.010 MeV/nuc to over 10 MeV/nuc, 
                ÃÂ·the elemental species helium through iron from approximately 10 keV/nuc to 15 Mev/nuc.

            <Description>
                The magnetometer (MAG) on Galileo was used to: 
                (1) map the configuration of the Jovian magnetosphere and analyze its dynamics; 
                (2) examine magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling; 
                (3) measure fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field; 
                (4) determine whether the Galilean satellites have intrinsic magnetic fields; and, 
                (5) investigate the nature of the magnetosphere's interaction with the satellites. 
                In addition to these primary goals, the magnetometer was also used to make extensive studies of the interplanetary medium, 
                the solar wind interaction with the asteroids Gaspra and Ida, and the Earth's magnetosphere.
                The system consisted of two triaxial fluxgate magnetometers, one placed at the end of a boom 11.03 m from the spacecraft
                spin axis, the other on the same boom but at a distance of 6.87 m from the spin axis. This dual magnetometer configuration,
                used to provide a real-time estimate of the spacecraft-generated magnetic field as well as providing redundancy in the 
                in situ measurements, was similar to that of instruments used on other missions (e.g., Voyager). The outboard sensors
                had dynamic ranges of +/-32 nT and +/-512 nT while those of the inboard sensors were +/-512 nT and +/-16,384 nT.
                This limitation to two ranges for each magnetometer assembly optimized the design to achieve low noise levels and small 
                offsets. In addition, the lower range of the outboard sensors was designed for solar wind and distant Jovian magnetotail 
                measurements whereas the higher range of the inboard sensor was intended for the inner Jovian magnetosphere.
                
                Calibrations for the instrument were performed in-flight using a calibration coil which generated a known magnetic field 
                at a set frequency, thus permitting the signal to be identified even when the ambient field was not entirely quiet. 
                This calibration method also permitted the orientation of the sensors to be well determined.

            <Description>
                The plasma instrumentation (PLS) for the Galileo Mission comprises a nested set of four spherical-plate electrostatic analyzers
                and three miniature, magnetic mass spectrometers. The three-dimensional velocity distributions of positive ions and electrons, 
                separately, are determined for the energy-per-unit charge (E/Q) range of 0.9 V to 52 kV. A large fraction of the 4-pi-steradian
                solid angle for charged particle velocity vectors is sampled by means of the fan-shaped field-of-view of 160ÃÂ°, multiple sensors, 
                and the rotation of the spacecraft spinning section. The fields-of-view of the three mass spectrometers are respectively directed 
                perpendicular and nearly parallel and antiparallel to the spin axis of the spacecraft. These mass spectrometers are used to 
                identify the composition of the positive ion plasmas, e.g., H+, O+, Na+ and S+, in the Jovian magnetosphere. The energy range of
                these three mass spectrometers is dependent upon the species. The maximum temporal resolutions of the instrument for determining
                the energy (E/Q) spectra of charged particles and mass (M/Q) composition of positive ion plasmas are 0.5 second. Three-dimensional
                velocity distributions of electrons and positive ions require a minimum sampling time of one spacecraft rotation, 
                typically 18.3 to 19.8 seconds. The two instrument microprocessors provide the capability of inflight implementation of operational
                modes by ground-command that are tailored for specific plasma regimes, e.g., magnetosheath, plasma sheet, cold and hot tori, and
                satellite wakes, and that can be improved upon as acquired knowledge increases during the tour of the Jovian magnetosphere. 
                Because the instrument is specifically designed for measurements in the environs of Jupiter with the advantages of previous 
                surveys with the Voyager spacecraft, first determinations of many plasma phenomena can be expected. These observational objectives
                include field-aligned currents, three-dimensional ion bulk flows, pickup ions from the Galilean satellites, the spatial 
                distribution of plasmas throughout most of the magnetosphere and including the magnetotail, and ion and electron flows to and 
                from the Jovian ionosphere.

Scientific Objectives:                                                        
                                                                              
The basic objective of this investigation is the study of plasma              
waves and radio emissions in the magnetosphere of Jupiter.  The               
Voyager 1 and 2 flybys of Jupiter have now clearly shown that many            
complex types of plasma wave and radio-emission phenomena occur in the        
Jovian magnetosphere.  These include electromagnetic whistler mode            
emissions called chorus and hiss, electromagnetic continuum radiation         
trapped in the magnetospheric cavity, electrostatic waves associated          
with harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency, and a wide variety        
of escaping radio emissions.  Some of these waves, such as the whistler       
mode emissions, are believed to play an important role in the dynamics        
of the magnetosphere by controlling the pitch-angle scattering and loss       
of energetic charged particles.  In other cases plasma waves provide an       
important diagnostic tool by revealing various characteristic                 
frequencies of the plasma, from which quantities such as the electron         
density can be computed.                                                      
                                                                              
Since the Galileo spacecraft will be the first orbiter of Jupiter,            
this spacecraft will provide a much more comprehensive study of the           
Jovian magnetosphere than was possible with the previous Pioneer and          
Voyager flybys of Jupiter.  Specifically, the orbit of Galileo will           
provide a survey of the magnetotail at distances of up to 150 RJ over a       
range of local times near local midnight, a region that has never             
previously been explored; repeated passes through the plasma sheet, and       
the tail lobes; and numerous close flybys of the Galilean satellites.         
Of particular importance will be a very close pass by the satellite Io.       
The Voyager flybys showed that volcanic gases escaping from this moon         
are the main source of plasma in the Jovian magnetosphere.  The primary       
energization of plasma in the Jovian magnetosphere is believed to occur       
in a dense plasma torus that surrounds Jupiter near Io's orbit.  This         
energization is associated with many complex plasma wave phenomena,           
including the generation of intense kilometric and decametric radio           
emissions.                                                                    
                                                                              
In addition to exploring regions never previously investigated,               
Galileo, by virtue of its long lifetime in orbit around Jupiter, also         
provides a unique new capability for carrying out studies of temporal         
variations on time scales that cannot be investigated with a single           
flyby.  For example, it is known that the kilometric and decametric           
radio emissions associated with Io and its plasma torus have temporal         
variations on time scales of weeks and longer. With Galileo these             
temporal variations can be monitored over periods of several years and        
compared with other remote sensing instruments. These measurements            
should be able to tell us, for example, whether the variations are            
associated with changes in the volcanoes on Io. Considerable interest         
also exists in searching for evidence of magnetospheric substorm              
phenomena, possibly comparable to auroral substorms in the Earth's            
magnetosphere.  With the Galileo plasma wave instrument, it should be         
possible to provide remote sensing of substorms in a manner comparable        
to the remote sensing of terrestrial auroral kilometric radiation,            
which is known to be closely associated with terrestrial substorms.           
                                                                              
To carry out comprehensive studies of plasma waves and radio                  
emissions at Jupiter, the Galileo plasma wave instrument incorporates         
several new features that provide improvements over the previous              
Voyager 1 and 2 measurements.  These improvements include (1) nearly          
simultaneous electric and magnetic field measurements to distinguish          
electrostatic waves from electromagnetic waves, (2) direction finding         
measurements to determine source locations, and (3) better frequency          
and time resolution to resolve fine structure in the plasma wave and          
radio emission spectrum.  The main instrument package and the electric        
dipole antenna system were designed and constructed at the University         
of Iowa, and the search coil magnetic antenna was provided by the             
Centre de Recherches en Physique de l'Environnement Terrestre et              
Planetaire (CRPE).                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
Calibration:                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
An extensive series of calibrations and performance checks were               
performed on the plasma wave instrument both on and off the spacecraft.       
Since the logarithmic compressors used in the spectrum analyzers do           
not give a true logarithmic response, the transfer function of the            
logarithmic compressors must be calibrated.  Because of the large             
number of channels, it is not practical to calibrate each frequency           
channel separately.  Instead, the transfer function is measured for           
each logarithmic compressor, and a frequency response calibration is          
performed at a fixed amplitude for all channels using that compressor.        
This procedure provides accurate calibrations for each frequency step         
because each band of the receiver uses a single filter and logarithmic        
compressor.                                                                   
                                                                              
A look-up table can be constructed which converts the telemetry               
data number to input signal strength.  When combined with the overall         
frequency response across each band, these calibrations are sufficient        
to determine the signal strength in all channels served by this filter        
band and compressor.                                                          
                                                                              
In addition to the amplitude response of the compressors, a                   
frequency response is also performed for each frequency channel. All          
frequency channels are checked to confirm that the filter bands have          
the proper shape and no spurious responses.  The effective noise              
bandwidths are measured by stimulating the instrument with a white            
noise signal of known spectral density.                                       
                                                                              
For the electric field antenna, the electric field strength is                
computed by assuming that the antenna has an effective length of              
Leff = 3.5 meters. This length is the distance between the geometric          
centers of the two dipole elements.  For the search coil magnetic             
antennas, the magnetic field sensitivity and frequency response was           
calibrated in the IPG magnetic field observatory at Chambon La Foret,         
France.  These calibrations were performed using a Helmholtz coil             
driven by a known AC current source.  The absolute accuracy of the            
sensitivity calibration is estimated to be about 3 percent. The               
magnetic noise levels were measured by placing the search coils in a          
mu-metal chamber, which shields the sensors from external noise               
sources.                                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
Operational Considerations:                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
Nominally, the instrument is operated any time low rate science               
(LRS) or greater data rate capability is available.  When LRS is the          
maximum data rate, the instrument is operated in its power-up mode,           
with the SA and SFR toggling back and forth between the electric and          
magnetic antennas.  When wideband data can be recorded or transmitted         
to the Earth, then the wide range of instrument modes and antenna             
configurations are utilized based on the science objectives for a given       
time interval.  The UVS instrument has a stepper motor that drives its        
grating which is a major source of magnetic interference in the               
frequency range from about 100 Hz to 2 kHz.  Every attempt is made to         
work with the UVS team to minimize the times during which the grating         
is moved while PWS is observing on the magnetic antenna.  In many             
cases, this requires a time- sharing arrangement which allows for some        
percentage of magnetic viewing time in an interference-free                   
environment, but which also allows UVS to observe with a moving grating       
in order to achieve its science objectives.                                   
                                                                              
Detectors:                                                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
The plasma wave sensors on Galileo consist of one 6.6 meter                   
tip-to-tip electric dipole antenna and two search coil magnetic               
antennas.  The electric dipole antenna is mounted at the end of the           
magnetometer boom approximately 10.6 meters from the spacecraft, and          
the search coil magnetic antennas are mounted on the high gain antenna        
feed.  The electric antenna consists of two graphite epoxy elements           
with a root diameter of 2.0 cm, tapering to 0.3 cm at the tip.  The           
dipole elements are mounted perpendicular to the magnetometer boom to         
minimize electric field distortion effects due to the spacecraft              
structure.  The antenna axis is also oriented perpendicular to the            
spacecraft spin axis in order to permit direction finding.  Each              
element is hinged 1.8 meters from the tip so that the antenna can be          
folded for launch.  A housing at the base of the dipole elements              
contains two preamplifiers.  These preamplifiers provide low impedance        
signals to the main electronics package. Each element is grounded to          
the spacecraft structure through a 250 MegOhm resistance to limit             
differential charging effects.                                                
                                                                              
The search coil magnetic antenna consists of two high permeability            
rods, 25.5 and 27.5 cm long, one optimized for low frequencies, 5 Hz to       
3.5 kHz, and the other optimized for high frequencies, 1 kHz to 50 kHz.       
The winding on the low frequency search coil consists of 50,000 turns of      
0.07 mm diameter copper wire and the winding on the high frequency            
search coil consists of 2000 turns of 0.14 mm diameter copper wire.           
The two search coils are mounted orthogonally to minimize the electrical      
coupling between the sensors.  Both search coils are mounted                  
perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis.  The high frequency sensor is      
perpendicular to the electric dipole antenna and the low frequency            
sensor is parallel to the electric dipole antenna.  Two preamplifiers         
mounted in a housing near the search coil are used to provide low             
impedance signals to the main electronics package.  Frequencies below         
2.4 kHz are obtained from the low frequency search coil, and                  
frequencies above 2.4 kHz are obtained from the high frequency search         
coil.                                                                         
                                                                              
Electronics:                                                                  
                                                                              
All of the signal processing for the plasma wave experiment is                
performed in a single main electronics package.  The main electronics         
package is mounted in the spacecraft body near the base of the                
magnetometer boom. Signals from the electric dipole antenna and the two       
search coils are processed by a wideband receiver and three spectrum          
analyzers:  a high frequency spectrum analyzer also called the High           
Frequency Receiver (HFR), a medium frequency spectrum analyzer also           
called the Sweep Frequency Receiver (SFR), and a low frequency spectrum       
analyzer also called simply the Spectrum Analyzer (SA).  The HFR              
provides 42 frequencies from 100.8 kHz to 5.645 MHz with a fractional         
frequency spacing of delta-f/f ~ 10.0% and a bandwidth of 2 kHz.  One         
spectral sweep is provided every 18.67 seconds with a dynamic range of        
100 db.  The SFR provides 112 frequencies from 40 Hz to 160 kHz with a        
fractional frequency spacing of delta-f/f ~ 8.0%.  This analyzer gives        
one spectral sweep every 18.67 seconds with a dynamic range of 100 db.        
The low frequency SA provides 4 logarithmically spaced frequency              
channels from 5.62 Hz to 31.1 Hz.  All four channels are sampled once         
every 2.67 seconds with a dynamic range of 110 db.  The data from the         
HFR, SFR, and SA (and survey wideband data as described below) are            
transmitted to the ground via the low rate telemetry at a bit rate of         
240 bits/sec.                                                                 
                                                                              
The wideband waveform receiver provides waveform measurements in              
three frequency bands, 5 Hz to 1 kHz, 50 Hz to 10 kHz, and 50 Hz              
to 80 kHz.  The frequency band to be used is controlled by the                
spacecraft Command and Data Subsystem (CDS).  An automatic gain control       
(AGC) circuit is used to control the amplitude of the output waveform.        
The AGC time constant is 0.1 seconds in the two high frequency bands          
and 1.0 second in the low frequency band.  The waveform from the              
wideband receiver is digitized by a 4-bit analog-to-digital converter         
(ADC).  The sample rate of the ADC is fixed at either 3,150, 25,200, or       
201,600 samples per second, depending on the frequency band selected.         
The waveform data can be transmitted in real time or recorded on the          
spacecraft digital tape recorder.                                             
                                                                              
The plasma wave instrument has several modes of operation and                 
methods of data transmission.  These modes are also controlled by             
the spacecraft CDS. The medium and low frequency spectrum analyzers and       
the wideband waveform receiver can be connected to either the electric        
dipole antenna or the search coil magnetic antennas.  In the normal           
mode of operation, the SFR and SA are cycled between the electric and         
magnetic antennas so that alternate electric and magnetic spectrums are       
obtained.  Since the search coils do not provide signals in the               
frequency range covered by the HFR, this analyzer is always connected         
to the electric antenna.  In the cycling mode of operation, the time          
required for a complete set of electric and magnetic field spectrums is       
37.33 seconds.  The SFR and SA can also be locked on either the               
electric or magnetic antennas to provide improved time resolution at          
the expense of complementary electric and magnetic field coverage.  In        
all cases the HFR, SFR, and SA outputs consist of an 8-bit binary             
numbers that are approximately proportional to the logarithm of the           
received signal strength.  In the ground data processing the data from        
the HFR, SFR, and SA will be displayed in the form of color                   
frequency-time spectrograms.  The frequency scale of the Galileo              
spectrograms will extend from 5.6 Hz to 5.65 MHz, and variable time           
scales will be available, ranging from 30 minutes to more than 24             
hours, depending on the application.  Normally, 24-hour spectrograms          
will be used to survey the plasma wave data.  These survey spectrograms       
will be used to select specific intervals for more detailed analysis,         
such as comparison with charged particle or magnetic field data, or           
direction-finding analyses.                                                   
                                                                              
The greatest flexibility in the operation of the plasma wave                  
instrument is available in the wideband waveform receiver.  This              
receiver provides very high resolution measurements of electric and           
magnetic field waveforms during times of special interest, such as the        
pass through the Io torus and satellite encounters.  The waveform data        
provide the highest possible frequency and time resolution, subject           
only to the constraints of Fourier analysis, delta-f*delta-t ~ 1.             
Although the waveform receiver has only three frequency bands, with bit       
rates of 12.6, 100.8, and 806.4 kbits/sec, several spacecraft modes are       
available for recording and transmitting the data to the ground.  In          
the highest time resolution mode, an essentially continuous sample of         
the electric or magnetic field waveform can be obtained over a                
bandwidth of 50 Hz to 80 kHz for periods of up to 18 minutes (the time        
required to fill the spacecraft tape recorder).                               
                                                                              
On the ground the waveform data will be Fourier transformed in                
discrete packets, usually consisting of 1024 samples, and                     
displayed in the form of a frequency-time spectrogram.  These                 
frequency-time spectrograms provide the highest time resolution data          
available from the Galileo plasma wave instrument.  In certain modes of       
operation, such as MPW, XPW, and PW4, the duration of the wideband            
recording can be extended at the expense of reduced duty cycle,               
frequency coverage, or analysis bandwidth.  To provide some wideband          
telemetry even when the high rate telemetry link is not available, a          
waveform survey output is included in the regular low rate telemetry          
data. This waveform survey output provides one block of 280 waveform          
samples every 18.67 seconds in two frequency bands, 5 Hz to 1 kHz and         
50 Hz to 10 kHz.                                                              
                                                                              
Filters:

axis of the sensor.  For radio waves which propagate above the                
characteristic frequencies of the plasma and which do not interact with       
the local plasma, this means maximum sensitivity is to sources in a           
plane perpendicular to the antenna axis, since the electric and               
magnetic fields of a radio wave are normally perpendicular to the             
propagation vector.                                                           
                                                                              
Data Rates:                                                                   
                                                                              
The basic low rate science (LRS) data rate of the instrument is               
240 bps. Wideband waveform receiver data rates range from 19.2                
kbps to 806.4 kbps, depending on the telemetry mode.  Rates of 94._           
kbps and lower can be either recorded on the spacecraft tape recorder         
or transmitted directly to the ground; rates of 403.2 and 806.4 kbps          
can only be recorded onboard for later playback at lower rates.               
                                                                              
Instrument Modes:                                                             
                                                                              
The PWS has several modes of operation.  The SA and SFR can either            
monitor only the electric antenna, only the magnetic antenna, or toggle       
back and forth between the two, obtaining a complete spectral scan from       
each antenna before switching to the other.  This toggling mode is the        
most commonly utilized mode.  There is also a mode which enables the          
magnetic search coil calibration tone.  When enabled, the calibration         
signal is excited for 56 mf (37.33 sec) at the beginning of each              
MOD(RIM,8)=0 until disabled.                                                  
                                                                              
The wideband receiver has three basic modes (analysis bandwidths)             
and can be attached to either the electric antenna or the magnetic.           
The three modes provide analysis bandwidths of 10 kHz, 80 kHz, and            
1 kHz although there is an additional mode which toggles between the          
10 kHz and 1 kHz mode.  In this mode, the waveform data is collected          
for 14 mf (9.33 sec) in one bandwidth and then for 14 mf in the other         
bandwidth.                                                                    
                                                                              
A wide range of telemetry formats are available for the wideband              
data. For any one of the three wideband modes, the instantaneous              
data rate is fixed (806.4 kbps for the 80 kHz mode, 100.8 kbps for the        
10 kHz mode, and 12.6 kbps for the 1 kHz mode.  However, the different        
telemetry modes differ primarily in the number of consecutive samples         
collected during an RTI.  This results in a variation in the duty cycle       
depending on the data rate allocated to this data stream in the               
selected telemetry mode.                                                      
                                                                              
Phase 2 Software Implications:                                                
                                                                              
In response to the failure of the high gain antenna and the                   
resulting reduction in downlink telecommunications capabilities for the       
Galileo spacecraft, the Galileo Project undertook a massive                   
re-programming of onboard software in order to enable science                 
observations in Jupiter orbit.  Coupled with flight software changes,         
modifications to the Deep Space Network were also undertaken to improve       
the overall downlink capability from the spacecraft.  Together, these         
actions increased the actual bit-to-ground capability from a maximum of       
about 10 bps to a maximum of 160 bps.  In addition, onboard data              
compression was implemented which increased the information content of        
the downlink by roughly a factor of 10.                                       
                                                                              
The PWS instrument has no microprocessor; all of its functions                
are hardwired, hence, no reprogramming of the instrument itself was           
possible.  One result of this is that the basic timing of the                 
instrument is identical to that described in the section above.               
However, significant software additions in the CDS and AACS were              
implemented which enable the PWS to perform its basic observations at         
dramatically lower data rates.  These changes can be categorized simply       
as editing and compression. The LRS observations are edited as                
described below to reduce the observations retained for downlink from         
240 bps to 65 bps.  The remaining 65 bps LRS data stream is then              
compressed using the same integer cosine transform (ICT) algorithm as         
used for the Solid State Imaging (SSI) data.  The severity of this            
compression is variable and can range from 40 bps to 5 bps, with 5 bps        
being the most often utilized data rate. The wideband data are not            
compressed and are minimized through editing functions only.  In              
addition, a new wideband telemetry mode was developed which uses bit          
allocations in the original LRS telemetry frame originally reserved for       
Golay encoding to produce a mode with drastically reduced data rate           
requirements.                                                                 
                                                                              
Realtime Science                                                              
                                                                              
LRS Editing and Compression:  The original PWS LRS data                       
stream is edited to reduce the data rate before compression from 240          
bps to 65 bps.  First, the 120 bits of waveform survey data are edited        
out of the data stream.  Second, all housekeeping and status                  
information is removed; if one assumes that the sequenced commands are        
executed properly and the instrument timing is maintained, the status         
of the instrument can be unambiguously determined from the most recent        
mode command and the current spacecraft clock.  A recorded mode like          
the original LRS but now called LPW preserves the full, original PWS          
LRS data stream and can be used to compare realtime science with the          
full data steam at limited times in case questions arise about the            
assumptions of correct command execution or instrument timing.  Third,        
only one sample per channel is preserved in a given 18.67-second              
instrument cycle.  Accordingly, only the first sample of the four SA          
channels are retained and only the first sample of the lower frequency        
HFR channels are retained.  Further, since there is an overlap between        
the upper frequency range of Band 4 of the MFR with the lower range           
of the HFR, and since the HFR has better sensitivity over this range,         
the highest frequency 6 channels of MFR band 4 are edited out.  What          
remains is a single sample of each of 152 of the original 158 channels        
in the low rate portion of the instrument.  This is the data stream           
which is forwarded to the AACS for ICT compression.                           
                                                                              
The ICT compression works on 8x8 pixel blocks of an image.                    
Since The PWS dynamic spectrogram can be thought of as an                     
image, the compression algorithm can be used to compress the                  
spectrogram prior to transmission to the ground.  One complication is         
that the PWS generally alternates between a magnetic and electric             
spectrum (at least for the SA and MFR channels) and the resulting             
alternating spectra add entropy to the 'image' and thereby reduce the         
compressibility of the data set.  Therefore, the electric and magnetic        
spectra are separated or 'unzipped' prior to compression.  Also, it is        
necessary to build up 8x8 blocks of the spectrogram.  152 channels can        
be broken into 19 8-channel segments, hence, 8 electric and 8 magnetic        
spectra are accumulated in order to make an 8x152 pixel strip (19 8x8         
blocks) of electric field data and a similar strip for the magnetic           
data.  (Note that the electric HFR data is included with the magnetic         
strip so that the 18.67-sec samples of the HFR channels are preserved.)       
 Hence, data is collected on 16 x 18.67 second time intervals (about 5        
minutes) in order to build the two 8x152 pixel strips.  Each of the           
strips is compressed individually with all 19 8x8 blocks in each being        
used to generate a downlink packet.  Since transmission errors will           
make decompression impossible for all data following the error, a             
5-minute gap will appear for any packet with a telemetry error.               
Fortunately, telemetry errors are very infrequent and the data which          
reaches the ground intact is virtually immune from the spikes typical         
of bursty bit errors in an uncompressed telemetry stream.                     
                                                                              
Once on the ground, the electric and magnetic strips are                      
decompressed and 'zipped' back together in the original time order.           
This allows sequential electric (or magnetic) spectra to be maintained        
together in the event the instrument is not cycled between E and B            
sweeps. The net result of this compression/decompression scheme is that       
the full temporal and spectral resolution of the PWS instrument is            
maintained even though the real data rate to the ground is as low as 5        
bps.  Of course, as in any lossy compression scheme, information is           
lost.  By maintaining the spectral and temporal resolution, the loss in       
the resulting data set is in amplitude inaccuracy.  Based on both             
ground experimentation and analysis of the Jupiter data, we believe the       
amplitude errors at 5 bps are no more than about 6 dB and are much less       
at the higher data rates (less severe compression).  At 5 bps these           
amplitude errors appear as 'tiling' in which all pixels in a given 8x8        
block have similar values but are different from adjoining 8x8 blocks         
or else the 8x8 blocks take on a checkerboard appearance.  The errors         
do not appear to be systematic, hence, we believe that averaging pixels       
in frequency and time over regions of the spectrogram where the               
spectrum appears to be 'simple' could provide a better estimate of the        
true signal strength.  Generally, however, the 5 dB accuracy will             
enable a wide range of studies without need to know the absolute              
amplitude better than a few dB.                                               
                                                                              
Recorded Data                                                                 
                                                                              
LRS data:  When PWS data are recorded, the full LRS data stream               
is recorded and played back.  This includes all status bits,                  
additional samples of multiply-sampled channels (e.g. SA channels), and       
the waveform survey data.  The discussion of data in the original             
instrument description is fully applicable in this case.                      
                                                                              
Wideband data:  The wideband data suffered the most through the               
process of reducing the downlink requirements.  Nevertheless, a minimal       
wideband capability was retained.  Beginning with the Io flyby, a new         
data mode was introduced which replace the Golay encoding bits formerly       
used for the LRS data format with PWS wideband data in the LPW format.        
This mode is called LPW and is usually modified with the term Golay           
bits to distinguish these data from the low rate data.  All three of          
the bandwidths (wideband modes) can be used with the LPW format and for       
each, a total of 832(????) contiguous 4-bit samples are acquired.             
However, these 832 samples are recorded only once per 2 minor frames,         
or 2.67 seconds, hence, the best spectral temporal resolution (temporal       
resolution of Fourier transforms assuming 1 transform per set of              
contiguous samples) is 2.67 seconds.  The spectral resolution (416            
spectral components is very competitive with the HPW (94._ kbps mode)         
but the temporal resolution is poorer by a factor of about 50.  It            
is this mode, however, which is used for virtually all of the orbital         
tour recording.                                                               
                                                                              
Some of the original wideband telemetry modes were eliminated                 
and those which remain (in addition to the LPW/Golay bits) are MPW,           
MPP, and HPW.  These provide 7.68, 19.2, and 94._ kbps, respectively.         
In practice, the LPW/Golay bits provides superior spectral resolution         
over the MPW mode at significantly reduced bit rate (due to the               
poor temporal resolution) and the MPW mode is not utilized in the             
tour.  Limited use of the MPP and HPW modes is included in the tour           
data set, however.                                                            
                                                                              
For all the wideband telemetry modes, an additional capability                
for reducing the downlink requirements was implemented.  This is              
an editing function often referred to as '1 of n-line editing' and            
consists of returning 1 of every n sets of contiguous samples recorded.       
Most of the tour data were returned with n = 2 or n = 4 so that               
the temporal resolution of the Fourier transformed spectra are a factor       
of 2 or 4 poorer than the original recorded data.  For example, in            
the LPW/Golay bits mode, if n = 2, the time between returned spectra          
is not 2.67 seconds, but 5.33 seconds.  Reducing the number of samples        
in a contiguous set of samples by returning every nth sample was              
never considered because this would under sample the waveform and             
lead to aliasing problems.  Likewise, truncating the number of                
samples in a set would reduce the spectral resolution, thereby                
defeating the remaining attribute of the wideband data.&quot;

            <Description>The low energy particle (LEP) instrument onboard Geotail is designed to make comprehensive observations of plasma and energetic electrons and ions with fine temporal resolution in the terrestrial magnetosphere (mainly magnetotail) and in the interplanetary medium. It consists of three units of sensors (LEP-EA, LEP-SW and LEP-MS) and common electronics (LEP-E).
                The Energy-per-charge Analyzers (EA) measure three-dimensional velocity distributions of electrons (with EA-e) and ions (with EA-i) simultaneously and separately, over the energy-per-charge of several eV/q to 43 keV/q. Emphasis in the EA design is laid on the large geometrical factor to measure tenuous plasma in the magnetotail with sufficient counting statistics in the high-time-resolution measurement.
                On the other hand, the Solar Wind ion analyzer (SW) has smaller geometrical factor, but fine angular and energy resolutions, to measrue energy-per-charge spectra of the solar wind ions. In both EA and SW sensors, the complete three-dimensional velocity distributions can only be obtained in a period of four spins, while the velocity moments up to the third order are calculated onboard every spin period (nominally, 3 sec).
                The energetic-ion Mass Spectrometer (MS) failed shortly after launch and no data are available.</Description>

            <Description>The objective of this experiment is to measure the magnetic field variation of the magnetotail in the frequency below 50 Hz. The MGF experiment consists of dual three-axis fluxgate magnetometers and a three-axis search coil magnetometer. Triad fluxgate sensors, which utilize a ring core geometry, are installed at the end and middle of a 6 m deployable mast. Three search coils are mounted approximately one-half of the way out on another 6 m boom together with search coils for the VLF wave in the PWI system.
                The fluxgate magnetometers are of standard design and consist of an amplifier, filter, phase sensitive detector, integrator, and a voltage-current convertor. The fluxgate magnetometers operate in seven dynamic ranges to cover various regions of the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind: +/-16 nT, +/-64 nT, +/-256 nT, +/-1024 nT, +/-4096 nT, +/-16384 nT, and +/-65536 nT, and supply 16 vectors/sec.
                The automatic range control of the fluxgate magnetometers failed in 1999 so the observable range was manually fixed in the +/-256 nT where it has remained ever since. On November 23, 2006, the fluxgate magnetometer at the end of the boom failed and data from the second magnetometer at the middle of the boom has been used ever since. Neither of the above changes substantially affect the data.
                The search coil magnetometer system consists of three sensors, preamplifier, amplifier, filter, multiplexer, and an A/D converter. The search coil magnetometers operate in a frequency range of 0.5 kHz to 1 kHz, and supply 128 vectors/sec. The fluxgate magnetometer operates in both real time and record modes, while the search coil data are used only in real time mode.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetic field experiment on the IMP-8 spacecraft utilizes a tri-axial fluxgate (saturable inductor) magnetometer. The instrument originally had three, automatically determined, ranges, +/-12 nT, +/-36 nT, and +/-108 nT, full scale. Because of a range-change circuit failure occurring in early July 1975, the experiment was commanded into a fixed +/-36 nT range on July 11, 1975 at 12:55:09 UT and has been in that range ever since. The measurements are A-to-D converted onboard, to an 8-bit resolution, yielding +/-0.14 nT quantization sensitivity, which is larger than the intrinsic sensor noise level of 0.025 nT RMS. The data from the two-bit (per component) adaptive delta modulator, incorporated into the instrument, and applied to the intrinsic sample rate of 25 vectors/sec., was never utilized, and hence the rate of the full (8-bit) vector words, which occur every 320 ms, represents the effective sample period of the instrument. The sampling rate is synchronized to the spacecraft clock; the basic spacecraft clock frequency is 6.4 kHz. The sensor unit is mounted on the end of a boom approximately 4 m from the center of the spacecraft.</Description>

            <Description>A modulated split-collector Faraday cup, perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis, was used to study the directional intensity of positive ions and electrons in the solar wind, transition region, and magnetotail. The collector plate split is perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis in order to measure the flow angle of the ions in a meridional plane; the flow angle in the spacecraft equatorial plane is determined from the fluxes measured as the spacecraft rotates.
                Electrons are measured using 21 logarithmically-spaced energy windows covering the energy/charge range between 23 and 1935 volts. Positive ions are studied using 24 energy windows covering the range between 50 and 7000 volts.
                The instrument has three operating modes. The tracking mode yields the best time resolution which is about 1 minute. A single energy window is used during a spacecraft rotation. The ion spectrum is obtained in eight spacecraft revolutions using a subset of the energy windows that track the peak of the solar wind. In this mode, fluxes are measured during 11.25-degree sectors of the spacecraft spin while the instrument is looking within the 90 degree sector centered on the sun direction and during 45 degree sectors for the remainder of the rotation. The other modes yield a spectrum using all 24 windows (with the same angular sectors described above) or a spectrum that results from integrating the observed fluxes over 45 degree sectors for the entire spacecraft rotation.
                Electron data are obtained in all modes, but are not usually analyzed.
                Parameters derived on a routine basis are proton velocity, number density, and temperature (most probable thermal speed). Those parameters are obtained from a non-linear, least-squares fit to the observed fluxes using a convected, isotropic Maxwellian model.
                Key Parameters for the Plasma instrument are computed at MIT using Level Zero data that are staged to the ISTP/CDHF approximately two weeks after being received on Earth. Thus the plasma instrument's Key Parameters lag real time by something greater than 2 weeks, but less than four.</Description>

            <ReleaseDate>2010-02-04T12:34:56.789</ReleaseDate>
            <Description>CORALL is a hemispherical electrostatic ion energy spectrometer with a fan-shaped field-of-view of 10 x 150 degrees. Satellite rotation with period about 2 minutes enables one to perform quasi-3D measurements of the energy/charge ion distribution function in the range from 30 to 24200 eV/q in 32 steps. The accumulation time on 1 energy step is 1/1024-th of the satellite rotation period, i.e. about 100 msec, and the scan period of 1 energy spectrum (32 steps) is equal to about 4 minutes. Energy resolution is +/- 5%, and the separation of the energy channels is 24%. There are 5 polar channels, at angles of 45, 70, 95, 120, and 145 degrees from the sun. Angular resolution is +/- 25 degrees in the polar angle and +/- 5 degrees in the azimuthal angle.
                Instrument CORALL was designed and fabricated jointly by IKI RAN and INTERCOSMOS of the Republic of Cuba.
                The instrument began operating August 14, 1995. However, there were problems with the telemetry system BNS which provides satellite rotation pulses. CORALL uses this pulse for performance of measurements in the inertial coordinate system. As of August 31, 1995 the complex BNS + CORALL is operating properly.</Description>

                Fields and waves are measured on the Tail Probe by the ASPI consortium of experiments, which includes: MIF-M -- fluxgate and search-coil magnetometers; FGM-I -- triaxial fluxgate sensor and plasma current sensor; OPERA -- a complex of electric field instruments; and PRAM -- the digital waveform processor unit. Two more ASPI instruments, ADS and IFPE, failed to switch on, likely due to hardware problems.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetic fields investigation selected for ISEE 1 and 2 had as its principal objectives the study of the magnetic signatures of magnetospheric phenomena and magnetohydrodynamic waves in and around the magnetosphere, and to provide supporting data for other experiments on the spacecraft such as the electric field, particle and plasma wave investigations. In this triaxial fluxgate magnetometer, three ring-core sensors in an orthogonal triad were enclosed in a flipper mechanism at the end of the magnetometer boom. The electronics unit was on the main body of the spacecraft at the foot of the boom. The magnetometer had two operating ranges of +/- 8192 nT and +/- 256 nT in each vector component. The data were digitized and averaged within the instrument to provide increased resolution and to provide Nyquist filtering. There were two modes for the transmission of the averaged data. In the double-precision mode of operation, 16-bit samples of data were transmitted. This provided a maximum resolution of +/- 1/4 nT or 1/128 nT in th low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity ranges. In the single-precision mode, any 8 consecutive bits of the above 16 bits were selected by ground command for transmission and the telemetry bandwidths of the magnetometer were doubled. This bandwidth varied from 2 Hz for the low-telemetry-rate, double-precision experiment mode to 32 Hz for the high-telemetry-rate, single-precision experiment mode. Operation of this experiment was near nominal until spacecraft re-entry on September 26, 1987. Users of data from this experiment should be aware of the fact that the averaging of 12-bit samples to create 16-bit samples worked well in the spin plane, but in situations during which the field along the spin axis was quiet relative to the size of a digital window, the magnetometer returned only a 12-bit sample. This was particularly noticeable when the spacecraft was in the solar wind and the instrument was operated in its low gain (8192 nT) range, and when the spacecraft was in quiet regions of the magnetosphere in the low gain mode. The former situation limited the resolution of the field measured to 4 nT in the double precision mode in which the magnetometer usually was operated, and the latter situation created, as the spacecraft moved through the large gradient in the Earth's magnetic field, a stair step pattern of field changes of size 4 nT which may be mistaken for waves. Another operational anomaly was the saturation of a sensor during gain changes. At these times, the 3 components of the magnetic field were deduced from one spin tone and the field along the spin axis, limiting the temporal resolution of the instrument to below the spin frequency. Every effort was made to minimize zero level errors, clerical errors and other data processing anomalies within the available resources. However, these resources were very constrained and funding ceased before the entire submitted data set could be checked. It is expected that eventually quality checks of the entire database will be possible, but in the meantime, users of the ISEE-1 and 2 magnetometer data are requested to report all suspicions about data quality to the principal investigator, C. T. Russell, for verification.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetic fields investigation selected for ISEE 1 and 2 had as its principal objectives the study of the magnetic signatures of magnetospheric phenomena and magnetohydrodynamic waves in and around the magnetosphere, and to provide supporting data for other experiments on the spacecraft such as the electric field, particle and plasma wave investigations. In this triaxial fluxgate magnetometer, three ring-core sensors in an orthogonal triad were enclosed in a flipper mechanism at the end of the magnetometer boom. The electronics unit was on the main body of the spacecraft at the foot of the boom. The magnetometer had two operating ranges of +/- 8192 nT and +/- 256 nT in each vector component. The data were digitized and averaged within the instrument to provide increased resolution and to provide Nyquist filtering. There were two modes for the transmission of the averaged data. In the double-precision mode of operation, 16-bit samples of data were transmitted. This provided a maximum resolution of +/- 1/4 nT or 1/128 nT in the low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity ranges. Operation of this experiment was near nominal until spacecraft re-entry on September 26, 1987. Users of data from this experiment should be aware of the fact that the averaging of 12-bit samples to create 16-bit samples worked well in the spin plane, but in situations during which the field along the spin axis was quiet relative to the size of a digital window, the magnetometer returned only a 12-bit sample. This was particularly noticeable when the spacecraft was in the solar wind and the instrument was operated in its low gain (8192 nT) range, and when the spacecraft was in quiet regions of the magnetosphere in the low gain mode.

                group of molecular ions with M/q ration between 20 and 80 amu/e. IMA has a 4.6 deg x 360 deg field 
                of view. Electrostatic sweeping performs elevation (+/- 45 deg) coverage. 
                The IMA sensor is a spherical electrostatic analyzer followed by a circular 
                magnetic separating section. A large diameter MCP with a discrete anode images

            <Description>The OMNI instrument is a virtual instrument representing the collection of Magnetometers, Electrostatic Analyers,
                and Energetic Particle instruments used in the creation of the OMNI datasets. The instruments used within the OMNI datasets
                come from the ACE, Wind, IMP8, Geotail, GOES and various other spacecraft. For any given time period OMNI uses a selection criteria
                to select the &quot;best&quot; available data to be used. Thus, only one magnetometer, one electrostatic analyser, and one energetic particle
                instrument are used for each data point within an OMNI dataset. Without looking at each data record it is not possible to tell
                which instruments contributed. As result, the OMNI instrument is used as a proxy for the set of possible contributing instruments.
                Complete details on the instruments and the selection criteria are available at the Information URLs listed below.

            <Description>This experiment (carried also on Pioneer 11) measured charged-particle composition and spectra using four detector systems: (1) the main telescope, consisting of seven elements and providing energy spectra (approximately 3 to 68 MeV for protons and 10 to 150 MeV/nucleon for oxygen), element resolution (through oxygen), and isotope resolution (for H and He); (2) the low-energy subsystem telescope, consisting of two elements and using a very small thin first element to extend the high-sensitivity proton measurements below 1 MeV (0.3 to 9 MeV) in the presence of a high gamma-ray background aboard the spacecraft; (3) the electron-current detector (ECG), consisting of a beryllium-shield silicon detector operated in current mode to measure high fluxes of electrons with energies above 3 MeV; and (4) the fission cell detector, recording fission fragments from the nucleon-induced fission of thorium 232 sandwiched between two large-area silicon detectors to measure fluxes of protons (above 30 MeV) in the presence of high fluxes of electrons. The experiment sample time was synchronized with the spacecraft spin, permitting sectoring of the readout of the main and low-energy telescopes into eight octants about the spin axis. Data also include the interplanetary region.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment consisted of three multi-element solid-state telescopes, all looking normal to the spacecraft spin axis. The high-energy telescope (HET) consisted of five collinear sensors, and measured stopping particles (Z = 1 to 8) in the energy range 20 to 50 MeV/nucleon and penetrating particles in the range 50 to 800 MeV/nucleon. Charge resolution for penetrating particles was possible up to 200 MeV/nucleon. The first low-energy telescope (LET-I) had four elements and measured stopping (Z = 1 to 8) particles in the energy range 3 to 32 MeV/nucleon. The second low-energy telescope (LET-II) had three elements and measured stopping electrons between 50 and 1000 keV and stopping protons between 50 keV and 20 MeV. For each telescope, count rates were obtained for each of several sensor coincidence-anticoincidence modes. Some of the rates from each telescope were sectored into eight octants in the spacecraft spin plane. In addition, three-sensor pulse-height analysis, with priority schemes favoring the analysis of heavier particles, was associated with each telescope.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment used seven miniature Geiger tubes in three arrays to measure proton and electron fluxes in interplanetary space and in the vicinity of Jupiter. Detector groupings were as follows: (1) a three-element (A, B, and C) differentially shielded telescope, with tube C shielded omnidirectionally and used for background subtraction to provide directional rates such as A-C (5-21 MeV electrons and 30-77.5 MeV protons) and B-C (0.55-21 MeV electrons and 6.6-77.5 MeV protons), (2) a three-element (D, E, and F) triangular array, each element responding to electrons above 31 MeV and protons above 77.5 MeV, and (3) a thin-window tube (G) with a gold-plated elbow as the aperture which admitted scattered electrons above 0.06 MeV while discriminating strongly against protons. Single element and coincidence rates were telemetered from the first two telescopes. The telemetry bit rate prevailing during the Jupiter encounter permitted directional sampling in intervals of about 14 deg of roll about the spin axis. For further details, see Baker and Van Allen, J. Geophys. Res., v. 81, p. 617, 1976.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetometer on Pioneer 10 (also carried on Pioneer 11) is a triaxial helium magnetometer with seven dynamic ranges, from plus or minus 2.5 nT to plus or minus 10 gauss. The linearity was 0.1%, and the noise threshold was 0.01% rms for 0-1 Hz. The accuracy was 0.5% of full scale range. The experiment worked as planned until November 1975, when the spacecraft was at about 8 au. No further useful data were obtained. The experimenter has used RTN coordinates in his data analysis. In this system, R (or X) is radially outward from the sun, T (or Y) is parallel to the sun's equatorial plane and has its direction given by the cross product of the sun's spin vector into the radial direction (i.e., into R) and N (or Z) completes the right-handed orthogonal system (positive northward). A detailed instrument description may be found in Smith et al., IEEE Trans. On Magnetics, Mag-11, p. 962, July 1975. Some data also include the interplanetary region. This instrument failed in October 1975 and was turned off in June 1986.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment used two telescopes to measure the composition and energy spectra of solar (and galactic) particles above about 0.5 MeV/nucleon. The main telescope consisted of five collinear elements (three solid state, one CsI, and one sapphire Cerenkov) surrounded by a plastic anticoincidence shield. The telescope had a 60-deg, full-angle acceptance cone with its axis approximately normal to the spacecraft spin axis, permitting 8-sectored information on particle arrival direction. Four elements of the main telescope were pulse-height analyzed, and low- and high-gain modes could be selected by command to permit resolution of the elements H through Ni or of electrons and the isotopes of H, He, and light nuclei. A selection-priority scheme was included to permit sampling of less abundant particle species under normal and solar-flare conditions. The low-energy telescope was essentially a two-element, shielded, solid-state detector with a 70-deg, full-angle acceptance cone. The first element was pulse-height analyzed, and data were recorded by sectors. Data include the interplanetary region.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer with two ring-core sensors at the end of a magnetometer boom and one ring-core sensor, at 45 degrees to the spin axis, halfway down the boom. The drive and electronics design had been used on the Apollo 15 and 16 subsatellites. The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine any planetary and remnant magnetic fields; (2) deduce the location and strength of the ionospheric current system; (3) determine the energy and mass balance in the upper atmosphere of Venus; (4) examine the nature of the solar wind interaction with Venus; and, (5) study the near-wake region of Venus and the structure of the Venusian bow shock. Additional objectives for interplanetary (solar wind) studies were to determine the perturbation of the near-planet region by Venus and to compare the properties of the average field at 0.7 and 1.0 AU.
                The instrument was intended to, in the worst case of low-bit and low-sample rates, measure one vector per 32 s. While in Venus orbit, when the spacecraft was coasting through the interplanetary region in the apoapsis mode, the sample rate was one vector per 8 s. While the spacecraft was passing through Venus' ionosphere in the periapsis mode, the sample rate was four vectors per second.
                The last full orbit of three-axis data was 3602, which ended on 16 Oct. 1988 at 14:30 UT. After this time, only one-axis data were available.</Description>

            <Description>The Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE) on the POLAR spacecraft is designed to measure the vector magnetic field at the spacecraft location in three ranges: plus to minus 700 nanoTesla (nT), 5700 nT, and 47000 nT. MFE consists of two triaxial fluxgate magnetometer sensors mounted on a 6-meter boom with associated electronics inside the spacecraft. The use of two separate sensors provides redundancy, and their different locations along the boom (one ~7.2m from the spacecraft axis (at the boom end), and the other at ~5.2 m, provides a measure of the spacecraft contribution to the measured fields.
                
                The fluxgate sensors are ring core-types, each composed of a 'driver' coil and a 'feedback' coil surrounding a ring-shaped magnetically permeable core. The drive coil is used to periodically drive the the core into saturation, while the feedback coil zeros out any DC field in the core. When the presence of external 'DC' fields in the core are sensed by the appearance of second harmonics of the drive frequency, the current in the feedback coil is changed to keep the core field near zero. Three orthogonal sensors make each of the two fluxgate units. 'Flippers' can mechanically change a sensor in the spacecraft spin plane with the one along the spin axis in order to determine any zero-level offsets in the measured fields. The magnetometer is a fully redundant system with duplicate processors, analog-digital converters, spacecraft interface electronics, power conversion circuits and two independent basic magnetometers, one designed to measure fields up to 47,000 nT and one designed to measure fields up to 5500 nT. Each magnetometer has two outputs that are continuously available, a low range and a high range.
                
                The instrument consists of dual triaxial magnetometers with flippers. Dual microprocessors and random access memory are used to process the data so that the data sent to earth are immediately usable by all ISTP program investigators without extensive calculations, as well as available on board the spacecraft to other instruments in final corrected form. One million bits of internal storage under microprocessor control provide snapshots with up to 4-ms resolution on command or triggered by changes in the data. The instrument ranges are plus and minus 256, 4096, and 65,536 nT, with corresponding resolutions of 0.004, 0.06, and 1 nT.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetometer system is a simplified version of the magnetometers flown on Mars Global Surveyor and Lunar Prospector. It is a tri-axial flux gate design that will be mounted on the STEREO ~4m boom just inboard of the SWEA and STE instruments. The flux gate sensors use a ring core geometry, with magnetic cores consisting of molybdenum alloy. The units are compact, low power, and ultra-stable. To optimize sensitivity at the low field values to be found in interplanetary space, the magnetometer dynamic range is divided into 8 ranges that are automatically switched whenever the field being measured exceeds a predetermined level. The maximum range is sufficiently large to allow IMPACT MAG magnetic field measurements during the commissioning phase Earth orbits.</Description>

            <Description>
                SWEA is designed to measure the distribution function of the solar wind core and halo electrons from below an eV to several keV, with high spectral and angular resolution over practically the full spherical range. This capability allows the distinction between these components in detail during both undisturbed periods and the passage of CME generated disturbances, when the interplanetary field rotates far out of the ecliptic plane. SWEA consists of a hemispherical top-hat electrostatic analyzer (ESA) that provides a 360 deg. field of view in a plane, combined with electrostatic deflectors to provide nearly 4 pi coverage when SWEA is mounted at the end of the STEREO boom. The inner plate radius is 3.75 cm and the plate separation is 0.28 cm. The resulting energy resolution dE/E is 18%, and the geometric factor is 0.01 cm2 ster E (eV). SWEA compensates for the effects of spacecraft potential on the lowest energy particles by having an outer hemisphere that can be biased according to the plasma density measured by the PLASTIC solar wind ion instrument.  Detailed descriptions of the IMPACT SWEA can be found in Space Science Reviews 136, 227-239 (2008).

            <Description>THEMIS Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) measures the background magnetic field and any low frequency (to 64 Hz) fluctuations superimposed upon it. The FGM can detect variations in the magnetic field within the accuracy of 0.01 nT. The THEMIS FGM uses an updated technology developed in Germany that digitizes the sensor signals directly and replaces the analog hardware by software. Using the digital fluxgate technology results in lower mass of the instruments and improved robustness.
                
                Development Institution: Technical University of Braunschweig, (TU-BS), Germany
                FGM Lead: K. H. Glassmeier (TUBS)
                
                The data are transimitted as several different types that vary in time resolution and availability. The fluxgate magnetometer engineering (FGE) quantity is available only during enginneering triggers(typically during perigee). FGE is provided at 1/8 second resolution, but is generally not processed to scientific quality standards. The fluxgate magnetometer low resolution data (FGL) is available during THEMIS fast survey mode. FGL is provided at 1/4 second time resolution.  The FGL data is spin-phase corrected and calibrated on the ground for use in scientific data analysis. The fluxgate magnetometer high resolution data is available during THEMIS particle burst mode. It is provided at 1/128 second resolution.  The FGH data is spin-phase corrected and calibrated on the ground for use in scientific data analysis. The fluxgate magnetometer spin fit data (FGS) is available at all times. It is provided at 3 second resolution; the nominal period of one THEMIS spacecraft resolution. FGS data is spin-phase corrected on-board. The equatorial correction is done using an A+B*sin(theta)+C*cos(theta) correction. Theta is the spinphase and a 0 spinphase is defined to be at the sunpulse. The Coefficients A,B, &amp; C that were used in spin-phase correction can be found in the THEMIS level 1 FIT data CDF. The axial component of the FGS data is generated by taking the average of the z measurements over each spin. Additional calibrations and cleanup of FGS data may also be performed on the ground. All data types are provided in Despun Spacecraft L-Vector Corrected (DSL), Geocentric Solar Eclipitic(GSE), and Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric(GSM) coordinates. Information about the requested spacecraft mode can be found associated with the THEMIS housekeeping data CDF. The housekeeping cdf stores engineering quantities.</Description>

            <Description>THEMIS Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) measures the background magnetic field and any low frequency (to 64 Hz) fluctuations superimposed upon it. The FGM can detect variations in the magnetic field within the accuracy of 0.01 nT. The THEMIS FGM uses an updated technology developed in Germany that digitizes the sensor signals directly and replaces the analog hardware by software. Using the digital fluxgate technology results in lower mass of the instruments and improved robustness.

                The data are transimitted as several different types that vary in time resolution and availability. The fluxgate magnetometer engineering (FGE) quantity is available only during enginneering triggers(typically during perigee). FGE is provided at 1/8 second resolution, but is generally not processed to scientific quality standards. The fluxgate magnetometer low resolution data (FGL) is available during THEMIS fast survey mode. FGL is provided at 1/4 second time resolution.  The FGL data is spin-phase corrected and calibrated on the ground for use in scientific data analysis. The fluxgate magnetometer high resolution data is available during THEMIS particle burst mode. It is provided at 1/128 second resolution.  The FGH data is spin-phase corrected and calibrated on the ground for use in scientific data analysis. The fluxgate magnetometer spin fit data (FGS) is available at all times. It is provided at 3 second resolution; the nominal period of one THEMIS spacecraft resolution. FGS data is spin-phase corrected on-board. The equatorial correction is done using an A+B*sin(theta)+C*cos(theta) correction. Theta is the spinphase and a 0 spinphase is defined to be at the sunpulse. The Coefficients A,B, &amp; C that were used in spin-phase correction can be found in the THEMIS level 1 FIT data CDF. The axial component of the FGS data is generated by taking the average of the z measurements over each spin. Additional calibrations and cleanup of FGS data may also be performed on the ground. All data types are provided in Despun Spacecraft L-Vector Corrected (DSL), Geocentric Solar Eclipitic(GSE), and Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric(GSM) coordinates. Information about the requested spacecraft mode can be found associated with the THEMIS housekeeping data CDF. The housekeeping cdf stores engineering quantities.</Description>

            <Description>The objectives of this investigation are (1) to investigate and characterize bulk-flow parameters and internal-state conditions of the solar wind as functions of solar latitude; (2) to investigate radial variations of solar wind properties between Earth and Jupiter; and (3) to investigate the solar wind interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. The instrument consists of two sensor systems and associated electronics that interface with the spacecraft. Electrons in the energy range between 1 and 900 eV are measured by a 120-deg spherical-section electrostatic analyzer with seven channel electron multipliers (CEMs) which cover a polar angle range of 146 deg. The plate spacing is 0.35 cm and the average radius of curvature is 4.2 cm. The solar wind ion analyzer makes three-dimensional measurements of solar-wind ions with energies in the range between 257 eV and 35 keV per charge. It consists of a 105-deg spherical-section electrostatic analyzer fitted with 16 CEM sensors which cover a polar angle range of 80 deg. It is mounted so that the first CEM views along the spin axis direction and the sixteenth at a polar angle of 75 deg from the spin axis. A stepping motor is used to rotate any one of seven apertures into place. The mass of the electron instrument is 2.6 kg. It uses 2.6 W of power and has a data rate of 24 bps in storage mode and 48 bps in tracking mode. The mass of the ion instrument is 4.1 kg. It uses 2.9 W mean and 7 W peak power, and has a data rate of 56 bps in storage mode and 112 bps in tracking mode.</Description>

            <Description>The objectives of this investigation are (1) to investigate source positions of travelling solar radio bursts in the range from dc to 1 MHz; (2) to investigate the large-scale magnetic field topology and the electron density along the exciter trajectory as a function of heliographic latitude and longitude at distances of 0.1 AU to approximately 5 AU; (3) to investigate Jovian radio source locations in the range from dc to 1 MHz; and (4) to investigate waves in the plasma between dc and 35 kHz, their instabilities, their energy transport mechanisms, and the thermal electron density. The instrument comprises three antenna systems (a 70 m tip-to-tip dipole in the equatorial plane, a monopole along the spin axis, and a pair of crossed-axis magnetic search coils) and four receiver systems (an rf receiver for the 1.25 kHz to 1 MHz range in two intervals from 1.25 to 48.5 kHz and from 52 to 940 kHz; a plasma frequency receiver covering from 0.57 to 35 kHz in 32 contiguous intervals; a fast envelope sampler from 10 Hz to 60 kHz with four commandable decade ranges to capture transient events; and a wave form analyzer, dc to 500 Hz, that operates in two frequency bands, from dc to 10 Hz and from 10 to 500 Hz). It also includes an active sounder for determining the ambient electron density. The instrument has a mass of 7.3 kg, excluding antennas and booms, and has a data rate of 116 bps in storage mode and 232 bps in tracking mode. It uses 9.9 W mean power and 10.4 W when the sounder is operated.</Description>

            <Description>The plasma investigation made use of two Faraday-cup detectors, one pointed along the earth-spacecraft line and one at right angles to this line. The earth-pointing detector determined the macroscopic properties of the plasma ions, obtaining accurate values of their velocity, density, and pressure. Three sequential energy scans were employed with (delta E)/E equal to 20, 7.2, and 1.8%, allowing a coverage from subsonic to highly supersonic flow. The side-looking Faraday cup measured electrons in the energy range from 5 eV to 1 keV.</Description>

The instrumentation included a High-Energy Telescope System (HETS) and a Low-Energy Telescope System (LETS). The HETS covered an energy range between 6 and 500 MeV/nucleon for nuclei ranging in atomic numbers from 1 through 30. In addition, electrons in the energy range between 3 and 100 MeV were measured by this telescope and an electron telescope. The LETS measured the energy and determined the identity of nuclei for energies between .15 and 30 MeV/nucleon and atomic numbers from 1 to 30. The instruments also measured the anisotropies of electrons and nuclei. In addition, electrons in the energy range between 3 and 100 MeV were measured by the electron telescope.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment was designed to study energetic particles in both planetary and interplanetary environments. In the planetary mode, particle sensing occurred with six different solid-state, totally depleted, surface-barrier type detectors. Both coincidence and singles count data were available from two of the detectors. By looking out at a shallow angle from behind the sun shield, measurements were made in regions where particle fluxes were so high as to saturate low-energy detectors. A current mode option was also available for high flux environments. In the interplanetary mode the experiment was equipped with a particle telescope which had solid-state detectors ranging from 2 - 2450 micrometers in thickness. The telescope consisted of two multi-dE/dx x E systems placed back to back in order to use a common all solid-state active anticoincidence shield. The telescope allowed the identification of protons, alpha particles, and heavier nuclei (Z from 3 to 26) in the range from 0.05 to 30 MeV. The combined dynamic range of all the instruments extended from approximately 1.E-5 to greater than 1.E12 particles/(sq cm-s-sr). The energy range covered extended from approximately 10 keV to greater than 11 MeV for electrons and from approximately 15 keV to greater than or equal to 150 MeV for protons and heavier ions. A stepping motor rotated the array of detectors through eight discrete sectors in 45-deg increments, thus allowing a 360-deg scan. For a description of the experiment see Space Science Reviews, 1977, v. 21, pp. 329-354.</Description>

            <Description>This experiment was designed to investigate (1) the magnetic fields of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune and (2) the solar-wind interaction of the magnetospheres of these planets with the interplanetary magnetic field out to the solar-wind boundary with the interstellar magnetic field, and beyond, if crossed. The investigation was carried out using two high-field and two low-field triaxial fluxgate magnetometers. Data accuracy of the interplanetary fields was plus or minus 0.1 nT, and the range of measurements was from 0.01 nT to 2.E-3 T.</Description>

            <Description>The plasma investigation made use of two Faraday-cup detectors, one pointed along the earth-spacecraft line and one at right angles to this line. The earth-pointing detector determined the macroscopic properties of the plasma ions, obtaining accurate values of their velocity, density, and pressure. Three sequential energy scans were employed with (delta E)/E equal to 29, 7.2, and 1.8%, allowing a coverage from subsonic to highly supersonic flow. The side-looking Faraday cup measured electrons in the energy range from 5 eV to 1 keV.</Description>

            <Description>This investigation provided continuous, sheath-independent measurements of the electron density profiles at Jupiter and Saturn and will provide similar measurements for Uranus and Neptune. It also gave basic information on local wave-particle interactions required to carry out comparative studies of the physics of the magnetospheres of these planets. The instrumentation consisted of a 16-channel step frequency receiver and a low-frequency waveform receiver with associated electronics. The frequency range for this instrument was from 10 Hz to 56 kHz. This instrument shared the 10-m antennas developed for the planetary radio astronomy investigation.</Description>

            <Description>The magnetic field experiment on Wind provides data for studies of a broad range of scales of structures and fluctuation characteristics of the interplanetary magnetic field throughout the mission, and, where appropriate, relate them to the statics and dynamics of the magnetosphere. The basic instrument of the Magnetic Field Investigation (MFI) on the Wind Spacecraft  is a boom-mounted dual triaxial fluxgate magnetometer and associated electronics. The dual configuration provides redudancy and also permits accurate removal of the dipolar portion of the spacecraft magnetic field. The instrument provides:
                
                * (1) near real-time data at nominally one vector per 92 s as key paramter data for broad dissemination,
                * (2) rapid data at 10.9 vectors/s for standard analysis,
                * (3) occasionally, snapshot (SS) memory data and Fast Fourier Transform data (FFT), both based on 44 vectors/s.
                
                These measurements are precise (0.025%), accurate, ultra-sensitive (0.008 nT/step quantization), and where the sensor noise level is &lt;0.006 nT r.m.s for 0-10 Hz. The digital processing unit utilizes a 12-bit microprocessor controlled analogue-to-digital converter. The instrument features a very wide dynamic range of measurement capability, from 4 nT up to 65 536 nT per axis in eight discrete ranges. (The upper range permits complete testing in the Earth's field.) In the FFT mode power spectral density elements are transmitted to the ground as fast as once every 23 s (high rate), and 2.7 min of SS memory time series data, triggered automatically by pre-set command, requires typically about 5.1 hours for transmission. Standard data products are the following vector field averages: 0.0226 s (detail data from SS), 0.092 s ('detail' in standard mode), 3 s, 1 min, and 1 hour, in both GSE and GSM coordinates, as well as the FFT spectral elements. High instrument reliability is obtained by the use of fully redundant systems and extremely conservative designs.
                
                The instrument was turned on on 1994-11-12.

            <Description>This investigation is designed to provide complete, accurate specification of solar wind flow parameters in real time. The SWE Faraday Cup sub-system was designed to measure solar wind thermal protons and positive ions. The SWE electron sub-system consists of two electrostatic analyzers, the vector spectrometer (VEIS) and the Strahl spectrometer. They were both designed to measure the solar wind electron distribution function. After the failure of the high-voltage power supply of VEIS in 2001, the Strahl detector was reconfigured to recover most of the measurement capabilities.
                
                The instrument is a six-axis ion-electron spectrometer which provides three-dimensional velocity distribution functions for ions and electrons, with high time resolution. The energy range covered extends from 7 eV to 30 keV for electrons in four different modes, and from 30 eV to 30 keV in four different ion modes. In addition, two Faraday cups are used to obtain three-dimensional measurements of ions in 15-s periods, in the energy range 5 eV to 5 keV.</Description>

            <ReleaseDate>2014-08-05T16:00:00</ReleaseDate>
            <Description>The data consist of fluxes of electrons at several tens (time-
variable number) of energy steps in the 0.01-20keV energy range, in 16 look directions.  
The data are organized in csv ASCII format for spreadsheet usage.  Any given 
spreadsheet may have hours of ~1-sec distributions from the low energy range or 
high energy range.  Deflection voltages used, between 1.31 and 21 V or between 21 
and 2800 V are given in the data arrays, with conversion factors to transform to
particle energy being given in documentation files.  No spacecraft trajectory 
data are included in these Level 2, reduced data records but see
http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA&amp;page=ancillary.  As of June 2012, these data were available for mid-2003 through Jun 2011, although for the 2003 cruise phase, a total of only several hours of data were generated and are available.</Description>

            <Description>This data set contains high resolution samples at about one-second 
                intervals of the interplanetary magnetic field measured by the Ulysses 
                Magnetic Field experiment. Field vector components are given in units of 
                nanoteslas and in RTN coordinates, where R is the sun-s/c axis, T is the 
                cross product of the solar rotation axis and R, and T is the cross product 
                of R and T. The field magnitudes in nT are averages of scalar magnitudes 
                at higher time resolution. Times are computed at the mid-point of each 
                averaging interval and expressed in Spacecraft Event Time - UT (SCET-UT). 
                Data gaps have not been flagged in any way - if there were no available 
                data in a particular hour then there is no data record for that hour. No 
                data from the Feb. 1992 encounter with Jupiter are included. Each file 
                includes one day of data. Parameter key information given below is specific
                to the data version at nssdcftp and at the ESA Research and Scientific Support 
                Department site identified below.  Further details on the magnetic field 
                measurements can be found in the following reference: Balogh, A., et al.,
                Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. Ser., 92(2), 221, 1992.

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s.

Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment)
                is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and 
                as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy,
                polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix.
                Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). 
                The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly
                up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA
                will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the 
                energies from 0.7-10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of 
                hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular
                micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0-180 degrees
                with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular
                to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. 
                The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. 
                Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, 
                synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. 
                The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron 
                and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments
                of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution
                for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data 
                followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. 
                The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted 
                (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin,
                all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late,
                but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. 
                Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again,
                but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to 
                six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; 
                an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment)
                is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and 
                as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy,
                polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix.
                Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). 
                The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly
                up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA
                will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the 
                energies from 0.7-10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of 
                hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular
                micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0-180 degrees
                with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular
                to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. 
                The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. 
                Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, 
                synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. 
                The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron 
                and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments
                of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution
                for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data 
                followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. 
                The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted 
                (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin,
                all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late,
                but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. 
                Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again,
                but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to 
                six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; 
                an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Spherical Probe Electric Field and Waves experiment for the Cluster Mission, by G. Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm.

            <Description>This instrument (CIS: Cluster Ion Spectrometry) is capable of obtaining full 3D ion distributions with high time resolution (in one spacecraft spin) and mass-per-charge resolution. The experiment consists of two different instruments, a Hot Ion Analyzer (HIA) and a time-of-flight Ion Composition and Distribution Function analyzer (CODIF). Extensive on-board processing is done, within its dual-processor Data Processing System (DPS). CODIF determines the distributions of the major ion species with energies from spacecraft potential to 40 KeV/charge with an angular resolution of 22.5 x 10.25 degrees and with two different sensitivities. The CODIF instrument uses electrostatic deflection to select by energy per charge, with subsequent time-of-flight analysis. The sensor primarily covers the energy range 0.02-40 KeV/charge, but with additional pre-acceleration for energies below 25 eV/charge, the range is extended to energies as low as the spacecraft potential. The HIA does not measure mass, but extends the dynamic range to the highest ion fluxes, and has angular resolution capability of 5.6 x 5.6 degrees for ion-beam and solar-wind measurements. The HIA is a symmetric quadrispherical analyzer of top-hat geometry, and uses microchannel-plate electron multipliers and position encoding by discrete anodes. A 2D distribution is obtained once per 62.5 ms, and a full 3D distribution of ions in the energy range ~5 eV/charge to 32 KeV/charge is obtained every 4 s. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Cluster Ion Spectrometry Experiment, by H. Reme et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The Waves of HF and Sounder for Probing Electron Density by Relaxation (WHISPER) experiment provides measurements of the electron density via active sounding of plasma resonances and records via passive wave analysis the natural wave emissions in the high-frequency range, from 4-80 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article WHISPER, a Sounder and High-Frequency Wave Analyser Experiment, by P. M. E. Decreau et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment)
                is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and 
                as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy,
                polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix.
                Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). 
                The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly
                up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA
                will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the 
                energies from 0.7-10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of 
                hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular
                micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0-180 degrees
                with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular
                to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. 
                The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. 
                Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, 
                synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. 
                The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron 
                and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments
                of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution
                for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data 
                followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. 
                The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted 
                (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin,
                all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late,
                but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. 
                Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again,
                but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to 
                six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; 
                an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Spherical Probe Electric Field and Waves experiment for the Cluster Mission, by G. Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Spherical Probe Electric Field and Waves experiment for the Cluster Mission, by G. Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Spherical Probe Electric Field and Waves experiment for the Cluster Mission, by G. Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

            <Description>The dual-sensor spectrometer RAPID (Research with Adaptive Particle Imaging 
                Detectors) analyzes suprathermal plasma distributions in the energy range from 20-400 KeV 
                for electrons and from 2 KeV/nucleon to 1.50 MeV/nucleon for ions. For more details of the 
                Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission,
                payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article RAPID:

            <Description>The primary task of this instrument (PEACE: Plasma Electrons and Currents Experiment)
                is to obtain the velocity moments of the distribution function of electrons as frequently and 
                as accurately as the spacecraft telemetry will allow. Detector counts are collected in energy,
                polar-angle, and azimuth-angle bins to form a three-dimensional matrix.
                Two sensors are used: LEEA (low-energy electron analyzer) and HEEA (high-energy electron analyzer). 
                The energy coverage is from 0.67 eV to 30 KeV in 92 levels. The first 16 levels are equally spaced linearly
                up to 10.7 eV; the remainder are logarithmically spaced. Both sensors can use the full range, but the HEEA
                will normally operate over a higher energy range than the LEEA. The LEEA specializes in coverage of the 
                energies from 0.7-10 eV, and has a geometric factor one fifth that of the HEAA. Both sensors consist of 
                hemispherical electrostatic analyzers of the top-hat type and a detector in the form of an annular
                micro-channel plate with a position-sensitive readout. Each sensor covers the range 0-180 degrees
                with respect to the spin axis, and they are mounted opposite each other with a view perpendicular
                to the spin axis, thus covering the complete angular range in a half rotation of the spacecraft. 
                The field of view perpendicular to the fan is 2 degrees for the LEEA and 5.6 degrees for the HEEA. 
                Energy resolution (Delta-E)/E is 0.13 for LEEA and 0.16 for HEEA. There are four sweep modes, 
                synchronized to the spin period (4 s), to vary the azimuthal angular resolution. 
                The spin phasing can be made coincident with that of the CIS instrument, to ensure that the electron 
                and ion moments will be measured simultaneously. On-board processing is used to calculate the moments
                of the distribution with an accuracy of 1% and to select suitable parts of the complete distribution
                for transmission. The normal science data format is based on one spin period, and consists of core data 
                followed by other optional distributions as can be fit into the available telemetry for that spin. 
                The core data (moments, spacecraft potential, and pitch angle distribution) are always transmitted 
                (if the spin is nominal). The next distribution is transmitted if, before the end of the spin,
                all the previous data have been sent. Thus the next spin of data will be transmitted slightly late,
                but all of its core data will be transmitted before the following spin of data is started on. 
                Eventually the transmission will catch up and be able to transmit the distribution after the core again,
                but only after some time. This applies at all telemetry rates. The instrument can adapt automatically to 
                six different telemetry rates: a basic 1.52 Kbps rate (CIS priority); a normal 2.52 Kbps rate; 
                an enhanced PEACE priority rate of 3.54 Kbps; and three burst mode rates, with a maximum of 15.98 Kbps.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz.

            <Description>The EFW (Electric Field and Waves) instrument consists of four orthogonal spherical sensors deployed from 50 m cable booms in the spin plane of the spacecraft, plus four deployment units and a main electronics unit. Each deployment unit deploys a multiconductor cable and tip-mounted spherical sensor. Each opposing pair of cables will be symmetrically deployed to a tip-to-tip distance of approximately 100 m, except for about a week at the beginning of the mission when 70 m will be used for one boom pair (the Z-booms) and 100 m for the other pair. The potentials of the spherical sensor and nearby conductors are controlled by the microprocessor to minimize errors associated with photoelectron fluxes to and from the spheres. Output signals from the sensor preamplifiers are provided to the wave instruments for analysis of high frequency wave phenomena. There is a 1 MB burst memory and tow fast A/D conversion circuits for recording electric field wave forms for time resolutions of up to 36,000 samples/s. Data gathered in the burst memory will be played back through the telemetry stream allocated to the instrument by pre-empting a portion of the real-time data. Incoming data are continuously monitored by algorithms in the software to determine whether to trigger the burst-playback mode. A large number of sampling modes is possible, yielding four possible telemetry rates from 1.440-29.440 Kbps. This data stream is transferred via the DWP instrument. The main measured quantities will be, in various modes: (1) the instantaneous spin-plane components of the electric field vector, from 0.1-700 V/Km, with time resolution down to 0.1 ms, in four frequency ranges from DC to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, 4 KHz, or 32 KHz; (2) the AC electric field components from 10 Hz to 8 KHz, within the dynamic range of ~3 mV/Km to 10 V/Km; (3) plasma density fluctuations within the range of 1-100/cm and in three frequency ranges from 0 Hz to upper limits of 10 Hz, 180 Hz, or 4 KHz; and, (4) density and temperature (in Langmuir sweeps) in the eV range, with a dynamic range of 1-100/cm. There is also a frequency counter covering the range 10-200 KHz. On-board calculations of least-square fits to the electric field data over one spacecraft spin period (4 s) will provide a baseline of high-quality two-dimensional electric field components that are present in the telemetry stream, except for periods when three or four sensors are in current mode. The spacecraft potential is calculated and transmitted via DWP to other instruments on board. The three components from the search coil instrument (WHISPER) are also available in EFW with a bandwidth of 4 KHz. For more details of the Cluster mission, the spacecraft, and its instruments, see the report Cluster: mission, payload and supporting activities, March 1993, ESA SP-1159, and the included article The Spherical Probe Electric Field and Waves experiment for the Cluster Mission, by G. Gustafsson et al., from which this information was obtained.</Description>

      <Caveats>
          The quality of ACE level 2 data is such that it is suitable for serious scientific study. However, to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, it is recommended that users consult with the appropriate ACE team members before publishing work derived from the data. The ACE team has worked hard to ensure that the level 2 data are free from errors, but the team cannot accept responsibility for erroneous data, or for misunderstandings about how the data may be used. This is especially true if the appropriate ACE team members are not consulted before publication. At the very least, preprints should be forwarded to the ACE team before publication.

      <Caveats>
          The quality of ACE level 2 data is such that it is suitable for serious scientific study. However, to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, it is recommended that users consult with the appropriate ACE team members before publishing work derived from the data. The ACE team has worked hard to ensure that the level 2 data are free from errors, but the team cannot accept responsibility for erroneous data, or for misunderstandings about how the data may be used. This is especially true if the appropriate ACE team members are not consulted before publication. At the very least, preprints should be forwarded to the ACE team before publication.

   <Caveats>
      The quality of ACE level 2 data is such that it is suitable for serious scientific study. However, to avoid confusion and misunderstanding, it is recommended that users consult with the appropriate ACE team members before publishing work derived from the data. The ACE team has worked hard to ensure that the level 2 data are free from errors, but the team cannot accept responsibility for erroneous data, or for misunderstandings about how the data may be used. This is especially true if the appropriate ACE team members are not consulted before publication. At the very least, preprints should be forwarded to the ACE team before publication.

            <Description>This data set contains magnetic field component
and magnitude averages every minute, with components given in spacecraft, 
GSE and GSM coordinates.  Standard deviations in the averages are given,
as are differences between the averages and model field vectors.
Geocentric (GSE and GSM) spacecraft position information is given,
as is ISEE1-ISEE2 separation vector information.  ISEE 1 spin vector
direction and ISEE 1 velocity vector information, relative to the 
Earth and to ISEE 2, are given.  Miscellaneous other parameters are 
also given.  Data are accessible as plots, lists and files from 
CDAWeb, and as CDF files from CDAWeb's ftp area.</Description>

            <Description>
                Phase angle is the angle measured from
                the x-axis to the projection of the look direction onto the xy plane
                of a local magnetic coordinate system where the z-axis is the magnetic
                field direction, the x-axis lies in a plane defined by the direction of
                corotation and the z-axis, and y completes the set of the right hand
                coordinate system.

                         magnetic wave spectra obtained during the period that the Galileo         
                         plasma wave receiver was operated during the Jupiter orbital              
                         mission (prime, GEM and GMM). The parameter provided for the

        <Caveats>The time resolution (cadence) is not constant. The time tag corresponds 
to the last 1.28s measurement in the 15.36s average.  Since the data is on average 
70% complete, this is quite often different from 15.36 seconds from the previous time 
tag. On average, however, it should be about 15.36 seconds.</Caveats>

            <Description>The MIT Faraday cup experiment on IMP 8 measures 
currents from solar wind ions, and from these measurements we calculate 
the velocity, density, and temperature of the solar wind. The IMP 8 data 
files consist of fine resolution data (approximately 1 minute resolution).

            IMP 8 spins with a period of approximately 2.7s. The Faraday 
Cup (FC) instrument scans the solar wind distribution stepping through a 
contiguous set of energy windows, one step per spacecraft spin. The FC 
instrument divides the spin into thirty-two, 11.25 degree angular sectors 
and integrates the measured currents over different angular sectors 
depending upon the Mode in which the instrument is operating. The border 
between two of the 11.25 degree angular sectors lies on the Sun-spacecraft 
line.

            The FC sensor collector plate is divided into two, 
semi-circular halves; the division line is parallel to the spacecraft spin 
plane which is approximately parallel to the ecliptic plane. The split 
collector allow determination of the bulk plasma flow relative to the spin 
plane; North/South angles refer to flows coming from above or below the 
spin plane respectively (flows from the South are designated as having a 
positive N/S angle).

            The bulk flow angle in the spin plane is determined from the 
measurements of current vs. rotation angle. The currents telemetered to 
the ground are the sums of currents for the two half-collectors (&quot;A&quot; and 
&quot;B&quot;) and, for the TMS and AQM modes, also the current for the 
half-collector &quot;B&quot;.

            Electrons are measured except for the eight angles near the Sun.

            The experiment has two memories only one of which is operating 
perfectly. As a result, only every other TMS spectrum is usable, and the 
time between spectra is usually twice that that would be expected from the 
spacecraft spin rate. The bad half-memory also limits the energy windows 
that can be used in the other modes, since they require both memories to 
hold the data. On occasion, the data are read out rapidly enough by the 
spacecraft to allow repeated use of the good half-memory, and the time 
resolution in the TMS is approximately 32 seconds.</Description>

               the ground are the sums of currents for the two half-collectors (&quot;A&quot; and 
               &quot;B&quot;) and, for the TMS and AQM modes, also the current for the 
               half-collector &quot;B&quot;.

               Electrons are measured except for the eight angles near the Sun.

                  The experiment has two memories only one of which is operating 
               perfectly. As a result, only every other TMS spectrum is usable, and the 
               time between spectra is usually twice that that would be expected from the 
               spacecraft spin rate. The bad half-memory also limits the energy windows 
               that can be used in the other modes, since they require both memories to 
               hold the data. On occasion, the data are read out rapidly enough by the 
               spacecraft to allow repeated use of the good half-memory, and the time 
               resolution in the TMS is approximately 32 seconds.

                Thermal speed is the most probable thermal speed (i.e., the square root of 
                [2kT/m(proton)]). To convert thermal speed to temperature in eV, multiply 
                0.0052 by the square of the thermal speed; 
                to convert to temperature [K], multiply the square of the thermal speed by 
                60.5.

            <Description>12-second Editor-A low-energy particle data from the Geotail spacecraft.

            Editor-A data are only acquired with the real-time operation in Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC),Japan, while the Editor-B data are 24-hours continuouslyrecorded in the onboard tape recorders and are dumpedover the NASA/JPL Deep Space Network (DSN) stations.

            The ion energy analyzer (LEP-EAi) has two energy scan mode: RAM-A (60 eV to 40 keV) and RAM-B (5 keV to 40 keV). RAM-B is selected to protect the very sensitive detector from intense low energy fluxes that are usually seen in the solar wind and magnetosheath. The energy scan mode is automatically selected onboard depending on incoming ion fluxes. At present, only the ion moments in the RAM-A mode are listed for the LEP-EAi data.

            The ion moment data of the solar wind analyzer (LEP-SW) should be used only qualitatively. The LEP-SW ion moments are listed when the energy scan mode of LEP-EAi is RAM-B.</Description>

            <Description>3-second Editor-A magnetic field data from the Geotail spacecraft.

            As of February 1 2008 the Bz component of the magnetic field has been corrected in the data set.

            The Geotail satellite has two editors onboard: The Editor-A data are only acquired with the real-time operation in Usuda Deep Space Center (UDSC) or Uchinoura Space Center (USC), Japan, while the Editor-B data are continuously recorded in the onboard tape recorders for 24 hours and are dumped to the NASA JPL Deep Space Network (DSN) stations.</Description>
            <Acknowledgement>In any publications, the use of the Geotail data should be acknowledged, for example, as &quot;Geotail magnetic field data were provided by T. Nagai, JAXA in Japan.&quot;</Acknowledgement>
