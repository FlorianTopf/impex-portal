                "description": "The ACE Magnetometer (MAG) experiment consists of two triaxial fluxgate magnetometers mounted remotely on booms extending beyond the spacecraft solar panels at four meters from the spacecraft center. Each identical sensor (M1, M2) has a wide dynamic range of sensitivity at +- 0.004 to +- 65536 nT and measures the three vector components of the magnetic field. Usage of twin magnetometer sensors for measurements of weak interplanetary magnetic fields is a proven approach based on experience from many past space missions. The MAG sensors were originally built as spares for the MFI instrument on the Wind spacecraft and have been given minor modifications for inclusion on ACE. Readout of MAG data includes three data types: (1) average magnetic field vectors from the primary and secondary sensors, (2) \"Snap-Shot Memory\" data, and (3) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) data. The average vector readout includes 216 bps corresponding to six vectors per second. These vector readouts can be split between M1 and M2 in the ratios of 3:3, 5:1, or 6:0. The \"Snap-Shot Memory\" stores field vectors at the maximum sampling rate of 30 vectors per second and is read out at 48 bps. The FFT readout includes 17 seconds accumulation of vector data transformed into spectral matrices of the components and total magnitude at a transmission rate of 32 bps. Prof. Norman F. Ness of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware is the MAG Experiment Manager.",

                "description": "The Solar Wind Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) instrument sensors measure solar wind electrons at 1 - 900 eV energy and ions at 0.26 - 35 keV. The instrument consists of separate electron and ion analyzers originally built as spares for the Ulysses mission. The two sensors both utilizes curved-plate electrostatic analyzers (ESAs) consisting of spherical sections cut into sectors. Biased channel electron multipliers (CEMS) are spaced along the exit apertures of the ESAs for ion and electron detection. Different CEMs sample different portions of the fan-shaped fields of view. The ion sensor consists of a 105-degree bending angle ESA with an average radius of 100 mm and a plate spacing of 2.84 mm. Sixteen CEMs contiguously spaced along the exit gap of the ESA give about 5-degree polar angular resolution over the approximately 70-degree opening angle of the acceptance fan. The electron sensor consists of a 120-degree bending angle ESA with an average radius of 41.9 mm and a plate spacing of 3.5 mm. Seven large-funnel CEMs along the exit gap give about 20-degree angular resolution over a 160-degree fan angle. The sensor geometric factors are 0.002 cm2-sr for isotropic response and 0.009 cm2 for unidirectional. Energy resolution is five percent for ions and twelve percent for electrons. SWEPAM data consists of ion and electron rates collected at each energy/charge (E/Q) step, polar lock direction, and azimuthal spin direction. A single spacecraft spin period of 12 seconds is sufficient for accumulation of count matricies to fully calculate the electron and ion distribution functions from which bulk moments (solar wind speed, density, temperature) can be calculated by ground data processing. Accumulated counts will actually be summed over one-minute intervals for increased statistical accuracy and for reduction of telemetry requirements. Limited data from single spins will be provided for timing of the passage of transient solar wind structures.",
